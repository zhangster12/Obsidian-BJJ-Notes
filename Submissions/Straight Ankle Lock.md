# Overview

# Setup
If the opponent crosses their feet on the Back or sets up a body triangle, then you can set up the Ankle Lock in the following ways:
# Keys
- Meet the blade of your wrist at the opponentâ€™s Achilles.
- Row your elbow back.
# Retention

# Defense
- **Putting the boot on**: This means putting your weight onto that foot.

# Variations
- Back: In the body triangle, you can trap the outside foot and pin it to the ground. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/arbm5b1_Qog)
