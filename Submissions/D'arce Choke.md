# Overview
The <u>D’arce</u>, or no-gi [Brabo Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FBrabo%20Choke), is a choke in which the top player uses both arms to wrap around the opponent’s neck, with an arm trapped. The <u>D’Arce</u> is very similar to an [Anaconda Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FAnaconda%20Choke), but the entry is on the opposite side.

## Side Control
- As the opponent shrimps away, control the knee-elbow space with your elbow (close to hips)
- Grab the triceps
- As you step towards the head, the opponent will frame you
- Switch the triceps grip to the other arm and slide it under the head
- Bring it as close to you, then grab the head with the other arm
