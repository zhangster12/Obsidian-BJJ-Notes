# Overview
<u>Omoplata</u> translates to shoulder-blade in Portuguese, as such this submission attacks the shoulder of the opponent by hyper-internal rotation. This can be achieved by shooting 1 leg through the armpit and over the shoulder. This submission is similar to a [Kimura](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FKimura).

# Defense
In the Closed Guard, the passer should be:
- Keeping their hands in the middle; the elbow shouldn’t be on the floor or across the midline.
- Preventing the guard player from getting their leg to the shoulder by posturing up.
- Walking around the guard player if they manage to break posture.
- Hiding the hand inside the thigh.
- Rolling through, which concedes bottom position.
- Lastly, rolling the guard player over your leg.
