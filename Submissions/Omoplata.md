# Overview
<u>Omoplata</u> translates to shoulder-blade in Portuguese, as such this submission attacks the shoulder of the opponent by hyper-internal rotation. This can be achieved by shooting one leg through the armpit and over the shoulder. This submission is similar to a [Kimura](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FKimura).
