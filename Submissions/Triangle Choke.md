# Overview
The <u>Triangle Choke</u> is a choke that encircles the passer's neck and 1 arm with the legs in a configuration similar to a triangle.

# Entry
The **Triangle Choke** can be setup anytime there is an isolation of the head and arm.
- From [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard), controlling the wrists and pushing 1 away to isolate the head and arm.
- In Lasso Guard, control the triceps where the hook is and shoot the legs up into a **Triangle**/[Trap Triangle](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FTrap%20Triangle). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7XBWcjFlqh0)

This can come after off balancing the opponent:
- From [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva), use the hips to push up to the **Triangle**.
- From [X-guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FX-guard), when the opponent tries to prevent you from [Wrestling-up](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Transitions%2FWrestle-up) by grabbing your collar, either scoop grip or pant grip, push off their hips to the **Triangle**.

- In the [Hip Bump Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FHip%20Bump%20Sweep), if they defend or you are unable to sweep, you can enter the **Triangle**.
## Sweeps
### [[Hip Bump Sweep]]
- If they post on their hand:
	- Drive your hip into them
	- Post on your left hand
	- Throw your right leg over their head and shoulder so that all your weight is on them
	- Bring your left leg over the right leg for a reverse triangle
	- On the way down, switch to a triangle
	- Controlling the head the whole time makes it easier to have a good bite
# Keys
You can under hook the arm or leg to help cut a better angle. You can also use the kipping motion to block their shoulder. If you're having trouble bringing the arm across, bridge, then pull it across. Finally, when you’re finishing the choke, point the legs in the same direction and press your far quad into the neck.

Sometimes the opponent will attempt to stack you. In this case, you can frame against your own leg while shoulder walking back before you cut an angle. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krq1YLXOZWs)

When you’re kipping to cut an angle, make sure that the leg that’s on the head is tight. Do this by grabbing the head or shin.
# Escape
To defend and escape a **Triangle Choke**, frame on the hips, posture up as high as possible, and pop your shoulder out.

If you can bring your other arm inside, they won’t be able to **Triangle** you.
