# Overview
The <u>Cross Choke</u>, or <u>Cross Collar Choke</u>, is characterized by crossing your arms as you grab the collar to force a submission. This puts pressure on the side of the neck, restricting blood flow to the head.

# Setup
## Grips
- [Baseball Bat Grip](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Grips%2FBaseball%20Bat%20Grip):
- [Cross Collar Grip](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Grips%2FCross%20Collar%20Grip):
# Keys
- Have the first hand be as deep in the collar as possible.
- Position the blade of your wrist at the opponent’s neck.
- If the opponent tucks their chin, force their neck up with the collar.
- Tuck the elbows and bringing the opponent close to you.
- Perform ulnar deviation of your wrist.
## Troubleshooting
- [Clamp Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClamp%20Guard): You won’t be able to grab a deep first grip, so the second one has to be deep.
- [Butterfly Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FButterfly%20Guard): Kick the passer’s legs out, so they won’t be able to escape.
- [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClamp%20Guard): Use your head on the mat as a base to avoid being swept. Walk the second hand to the other side, press your elbow into their neck, and get the second grip.
# Transitioning
- 
# Defense
- Tuck your chin, keep good posture by stiff arming the guard player, and break the grips.
## Escapes
- [[Bridge & Roll Escape]]: From Mount to make the top player release the grip or escape to top Closed Guard, which may make it easier to grip the grips.
# Variations
- **Palm up/palm down**: This is the most common variation. The second arm goes over the first arm, but you need to cut an angle to reach the fabric of the gi.
- **Palm up/palm up**: The second hand reaches underneath the first hand, which makes it easier to reach for the collar.
- [Brabo Grip](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Grips%2FCross%20Collar%20Grip): This is similar to the palm up/palm down grip, but using the lapel over their back.
- [Baseball Bat Grip](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Grips%2FBaseball%20Bat%20Grip): You pull the passer in as you bring the top hand over their head and to the other side of their neck. You will finish with palm up/palm down configuration. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=930LolYQ-hI)
