# Overview
The <u>Cross Choke</u>, or <u>Cross Collar Choke</u>, is characterized by crossing your arms as you grab the collar to force a submission. This puts pressure on the side of the neck, restricting blood flow to the head.

# Setup
The <u>Cross Choke</u> can be setup with [Cross Collar Grip](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Grips%2FCross%20Collar%20Grip) or [Baseball Bat Grip](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Grips%2FBaseball%20Bat%20Grip) in [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount), [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard), or [Clamp Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClamp%20Guard).
# Keys
While a <u>Cross Choke</u> can be applied in different positions, the main ideas are the same:
- Have the first hand be as deep in the collar as possible.
- Position the blade of your wrist at the opponent’s neck.
- If the opponent tucks their chin, force their neck up with the collar.
- Tuck the elbows and bringing the opponent close to you.
- Perform ulnar deviation of your wrist.
## Specifics
- [Clamp Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClamp%20Guard): You won’t be able to grab a deep first grip, so the second one has to be deep.
- [Butterfly Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FButterfly%20Guard): Kick the passer’s legs out, so they won’t be able to escape.
- [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClamp%20Guard): Use your head on the mat as base to avoid being swept. Walk the second hand to the other side, press your elbow into their neck, and get the second grip.
# Defense
- [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard): Tuck your chin, keep good posture by stiff arming the guard player, and break the grips.
- [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount): [Bridge & Roll](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Escapes%2FBridge%20%26%20Roll%20Escape) to make the top player release the grip or escape to top [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard), which may make it easier to grip the grips.
# Variations
There are multiple configurations of grips for the <u>Cross Choke</u>:
- **Palm up/palm down**: This is the most common variation. The second arm goes over the first arm, but you need to cut an angle to reach the fabric of the gi.
- **Palm up/palm up**: The second hand reaches underneath the first hand, which makes it easier to reach for the collar.
- [Brabo Grip](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Grips%2FCross%20Collar%20Grip): This is similar to the palm up/palm down grip, but using the lapel over their back.
- [Baseball Bat Grip](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Grips%2FBaseball%20Bat%20Grip): You pull the passer in as you bring the top hand over their head and to the other side of their neck. You will finish with palm up/palm down configuration. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=930LolYQ-hI)
