# Setup
- Butterfly Guard: 
- Closed Guard: Break the passer’s posture by dropping your hips.
# Keys
- **Grips**:
- **Hand position**: Point your knuckles down and punch it to the passer’s hip pocket; this activates your triceps.
- **Chest position**: Cover their triceps with your chest.
## Troubleshooting
- **Passer keeps their elbow tight**: Drag the opposite arm.
- **If you’re stuck in Butterfly or Butterfly-Half Guard**: Pull your outside leg out so you’re perpendicular to them as you’re dragging the arm.
