# Overview
A <u>Wrestle-up</u> in BJJ refers to the act of transitioning from a ground position, typically when playing guard, to a standing position, ready to wrestle the opponent to the mat.

# Setup
- **Weight on back foot**: To <u>Wrestle-up</u>, the passer’s front leg must be light, while being heavy on their back leg, otherwise you won’t be able to pick it up.
## Guards

- [X-guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Nodes%2FGuards%2FX-guard): Extend them away and bring their hands and far foot to the mat ([1](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Mp7opsMDHJY)).
If the passer is leaning their weight back on their far leg or upright, then Wrestling-up will be a good option to reverse position, especially if they passer is a wrestler who doesn’t want to be on their back.

If the passer is kneeling, then control the far side knee and toes.
