# Overview
The <u>Brabo Grip</u> is a powerful grip in the gi, where you control the opponent’s lapel diagonally across the back. This can lead to the [Brabo Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FBrabo%20Choke) or [Cross Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FCross%20Choke).
