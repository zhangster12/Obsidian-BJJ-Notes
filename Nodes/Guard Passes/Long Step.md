# Entry
## Passes
- [Knee Cut](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FKnee%20Cut): When the guard player has a [RDLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FReverse%20DLR) hook and not framing at the shoulder, use movement and speed to distract them.

# Keys
- **Grips**: ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FIBw6DJgAw&t=7s)) Grab a collar and pant grip in the gi or head and ankle for no-gi.
- **Shift back**: If you lean forward, you place your weight onto the guard player, making it easy for them to sweep you.
- 
- Drop the knee and elbow, then hips to the mat, while stepping the leg out.
- Then tripod.
## Troubleshooting
- **Passer comes up**: Stay on your toes, point your knee towards them, and drive your head into them after you complete the pass.
