# Overview
The <u>São Paulo Pass</u>, also known as the <u>Tozi Pass</u> or hammerlock, is a pass that traps the guard player's hand so you can apply pressure to their shoulder and limit attacks while passing the guard.

# Keys
- **Head pressure**: Maintain pressure into the guard player’s chest and shoulders to keep them pinned while you cut an angle on their legs.
- **Spinal misalignment**: Moving their legs out of line with their spine makes it harder for them to keep their legs closed.

# Variations
- **Arm passed**: Pin an arm. This has the most control.
- **Lapel passed (gi)**: Remove the lapel and use it to wrap around the arm as you pass it behind the back. The lapel is more assessable, it slides to the elbow and the guard player can still use their arm to frame. You more easily pin the arm to the mat and upgrade to the arm passed variation.
- **Underhook**:
