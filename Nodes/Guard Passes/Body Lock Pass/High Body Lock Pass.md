Main Page: [[Body Lock Pass]]
# Overview
The <u>High Body Lock</u> is a variation of the [[Body Lock Pass]] where you’re as high on the guard player as possible. It’s essentially double underhooks with your hands connected behind their head.
# Setup
## Guards
- [Chest-to-Chest Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FChest-to-Chest%20Half%20Guard): If you have an underhook on one side, fight for an underhook on the other side, espesially if they frame on your knee or hip. Pommel your head to the other side, then underhook.
