# Overview
The <u>Shin Pin</u> is a pass where you press your shin into the guard player’s shin, pinning it.
# Entry
# Passes
- [Circle Pass](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FCircle%20Pass): Pass laterally, then press your shin into the guard player’s shin.
# Keys
- **Shin position**: Make sure the sharp edge of your shin presses into the sharp edge of the guard player’s shin.
## Troubleshooting
- 
# Transitioning
- **Guard player extends their leg away**: The main response for when you press your shin into their leg is to extend their leg away, because it hurts, effectively allowing you to pass in [KOB](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Nodes%2FPositions%2FKnee%20On%20Belly) or [Side Control](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Nodes%2FPositions%2FSide%20Control).
- **Guard player keeps their knee close**: If they remain stubborn with their knee, then drop into the [Knee Cut](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Nodes%2FGuard%20Passes%2FKnee%20Cut).
## Guards
- [[Half Guard]]:
## Positions
- [[Knee On Belly]]:
- [[Side Control]]:
## Passes
- [[Knee Cut]]: Slice across their leg.
# Counter
- **Knees to chest**: Keep your knees close to your chest.
- **Frames**: Because the passer is upright when pressing their shin into you, frame on the shoulder. If their head is down, then their weight is on you and not on the foot.
