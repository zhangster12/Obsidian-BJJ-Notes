# Overview
The <u>Split Sweep</u> is a sweep from DLR, where you split the passer’s base then sweeping them.

# Setup
## Guards
- [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva):
# Keys
- **Split the legs**: Use your legs to split the passer’s base, forcing them to fall into the sweep direction.
- **Keep your leg flat on the mat**: You’re essentially pulling the rug from underneath their feet, so if your leg is not at the level of their back of their ankle, then it’ll be harder to sweep.
