# Overview
A <u>Butterfly Sweep</u> is a sweep from Butterfly Guard, where you use your Butterfly hooks inside the top player's thighs and grips to lift their hips and roll them over your shoulder.

# Setup
## Guards
- Butterfly Guard:
# Keys
- 
- **Knee position**: Keep the knee that’s hooked pointed towards the ceiling and retracted towards your shoulder.
- Drive off the toes with the foot by your butt.
- Tuck the trapped arm deeply and grab at the elbow.
- Bring the passer’s head below their hips.
- Bring the passer’s shoulder to the head. This twists their upper body, making their spine out of alignment.
- Come onto your knees if you’re having trouble completing the sweep.
## Troubleshooting
- **Passer posts leg**: (1) Push their knee/foot away or (2) plant your foot on their knee/foot and chop it, or (3) reverse shrimp/hop.
- **On knees**: (1) Kick their knee out, (2) Scissor Sweep with the Butterfly hook, or (3) if their weight is back, Wrestle-up.
# Transitioning
- **Leg is too close**: Underhook and transition to [X-guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FX-guard) or [Ashi](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FAshi%20Garami).

# Variations
## Grips
- **2-on-1**: Instead of gripping outside the triceps, grip at the interior crux of the elbow. To reinforce this, grab your own wrist with the outside arm.
- **Double underhooks**:
- **Over/under**:
- **Sleeve/belt or back (gi)**:
- **Shoulder crunch**: While you can sweep towards the side of the trapped arm, you can also sweep to the opposite side, again, by bringing the opposite side shoulder to the mat.
