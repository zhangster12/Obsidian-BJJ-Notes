# Overview
A <u>Rear Naked Choke</u>, or <u>RNC</u>, is a strangle where you wrap an arm around your opponent's neck from behind and apply pressure with the forearm and biceps to restrict blood flow to the brain.

# Defense
- **Hand fight**: Control the bottom arm with a 2-on-1 grip.
- **Tuck your chin**: This makes it harder for your opponent to constrict your airways and blood vessels.
- **Late stage hand fight**: If your opponent gets their other arm behind your head, peel that before addressing the bottom arm.
