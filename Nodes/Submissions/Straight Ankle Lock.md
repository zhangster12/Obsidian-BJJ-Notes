# Keys
- **Ankle control**: ([1](https://youtu.be/4PQk7VQw-p8?si=volrs2KO5wnl1szj&t=301)) Make sure your opponent’s ankle is trapped in your armpit by bringing your hand towards your shoulder. Don’t allow your hand to drift away.
- **Cover the toes**: Row your elbow back to prevent them from flexing their foot.
- **Ankle hyperextension**: Extending the ankle stretches the muscles and tendons, causing pain.
- **Achilles tendon compression**: Pushing the bony part of your forearm into their Achilles causes pain.
# Troubleshooting
- 
# Transitioning
- [[Supine Guard]]: (1) Come up into top position. (2) Inexperienced opponents can sometimes grab your ankle. You’ll have a hard time finishing the <u>Straight Ankle Lock</u>, so stand up.
# Defense
- **Remove frames**: Strip all frames and hooks to prevent your opponent from using their weight and hips.
- **Put the boot on**: Flex your foot to prevent hyperextension.
- **Wrist control**: This prevents your opponent from controlling your ankle .
- **Stand up**: Put all your weight onto your foot to prevent hyperextension, as the bottom player is conceding bottom position.
# Variations
- **Elbow deep**: This puts less pressure on the Achilles tendon.
- **Wrist deep**: Meet the blade of your wrist at the opponent’s Achilles. You can either grab your other hand or your own lapel.
