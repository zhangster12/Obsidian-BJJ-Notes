# Overview
The <u>D’arce</u>, or no-gi [Brabo Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FBrabo%20Choke), is a choke in which the top player uses both arms to wrap around the opponent’s neck, with an arm trapped. The <u>D’Arce</u> is very similar to an [Anaconda Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FAnaconda%20Choke), but the entry is on the opposite side.
