# Setup
## Guards
- [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Nodes%2FGuards%2FClosed%20Guard): Teepee your hands to break the passer’s posture, then sit up like you’re doing a Hip Bump Sweep and shoot your arm over their elbow, elbow deep.
- [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard): Sit up and shoot your leg through as you figure 4 grip their arm.
## Sweeps
- [Hip Bump Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FHip%20Bump%20Sweep): If the passer drives into you, figure 4 grip their arm as you re-lock your legs perpendicular to them.

## Troubleshooting
- 
# Transitioning
- **Passer straightens their arm**: Place your knee behind their head to transition into [Ude Gatami](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Ude%20Gatami) or skip it and force them to roll all the way through to an [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Nodes%2FSubmissions%2FArmbar).

# Defense
- **Tuck your elbows**: Keep your elbow by your side and behind your first. If you’re wearing a gi, you can grab your own lapel.
- **Make your hand heavy**: By placing your weight onto your hand and mat, the guard player won’t be able to move your hand.
