# Overview
The <u>Kimura</u> is a submission that attacks the shoulder by forcing excessive shoulder internal rotation. This can be applied from the guard, [[North-South]], or [[Side Control]]. The [[Americana]] is the opposite, as it forces excessive external rotation.

# Common Mechanics
- **Bent elbow**: If you don’t keep your opponent’s arm bent at 90 deg, then there is no <u>Kimura</u>. By keeping their elbow in line with their shoulder, this ensures you’re attacking their shoulder.
- **Wrist control**: By using a motorcycle grip and turn your wrist down, your opponent will have difficulty turning their wrists back to push against you ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/bjj/comments/7d5a7y/kimura_grip_problemas/)).
- **Engage your whole body**: Using your whole body will make the Kimura much easier to finish, whereas if you’re only using your arms, it’s much more difficult and uses more effort. In [[Kimura (Guard)]] and [[Kimura (North-South)]], glue your chest to their triceps and place your weight on the hip that’s facing their head.
- **Finishing mechanics**: Rotating their wrist behind their back forces rotation of the shoulder and the tap.
## Troubleshooting
- 
# Defense
- **Tuck your elbow**: By keeping your elbow tucked and tight to your body, your opponent will have difficulty rotating your shoulder. If you’re wearing a gi, you may grab your own collar.
