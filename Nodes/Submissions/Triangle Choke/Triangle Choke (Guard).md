# Keys
- **Head control**.
- **Arm position**: Pull their arm across your body.
- **Circular control**: Always keep a closed loop around their head by grabbing your own shin.
- **Cut the angle**: Underhook the leg or arm. 
- **Block the shoulder**: Kip at their shoulder to pack it back. 
- **Leg direction**: Point your legs in the same direction and press your far quad into their neck.
## Troubleshooting
- **Passer stacks you**: Frame against your own leg while shoulder walking back before you cut an angle. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krq1YLXOZWs)
