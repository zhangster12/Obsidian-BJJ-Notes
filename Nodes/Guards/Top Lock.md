# Overview
The <u>Top Lock</u> is a variation of [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard) where your ankles are crossed high up on the passer’s back, with one elbow across the centerline. This way, you can better control their posture as well as attack their arm.

# Entry
## Guards
- [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard): (1) Grab the cross collar and sleeve and pull them towards you as you push off their hip and cut an ankle. (2) Throw your legs over their shoulder very quickly.

# Retention
- Posture control: 
- **Collar grip:** The highest possible grip on the passer’s collar will have the greatest amount of control.

- **Leg position**: Keep the leg aligned with their spine on bottom to eliminate space and prevent posture, point your toes to engage hamstrings, and grab your shin for control.
