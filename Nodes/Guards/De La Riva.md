# Passing
- **Kill the hook**: (1) Extend your leg, (2) push it down, or (3) reach under your own leg to push the hook down. To prevent the guard player from re-hooking, turn your knee out and drive it out.
- **Push down on the frame**: After pushing down, place their leg between your legs. (1) Drive your other knee into their thigh of their other leg or ([2](https://www.impact-athletes.com/members/dlr-to-side-smash-pass/)) place their shin below your knees.
## Guards
- [[Half Guard]]: If the guard player strips your grips.
## Passes
- [[Knee Cut]]:
- [[Leg Drag]]:
- [[Smash Pass]]: 
## Positions
- [[Headquarters]]: (1) Control the leg on your hip and squat on it or (2) if the passer pushes back.
# Retention
- **<u>DLR</u> hook**: Turn your hooked knee in or pointed towards the ceiling to make it difficult to remove. Keep the foot flexed by the hip.
- **Ankle control**: This prevents the passer from running away. Control the heel to prevent them from rotating their leg and under the foot to control their base.
- **Head position**: Keep your head on the mat.
- **Distance management**: Frame on the hip (or hook onto their other leg) with your other leg.
- **Upper body control**: Use a [Cross Collar Grip](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Grips%2FCross%20Collar%20Grip) to adjust your body position depending on if they posture up or crouch. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/02jQ2CylttM).
- **Kuzushi**: Constantly off balance the passer to prevent them from getting grips to pass and attack when their hands are on the mat.
## Troubleshooting
- **Too close to foot**: Shoulder walk yourself away while framing on the passer’s foot, or you won’t be able to establish a strong hook.
- **Off balancing**: Bring your knees to your chest first, then float them away, while framing on the hip and with a Cross Collar Grip.
- **Far foot too far**: If their far foot is too far to grab, (1) cross your feet, pinch the knees, and turn yourself in the direction. (2) Use a Deep DLR hook.
# Transitioning
- **Off balancing overhead**: ([1](https://youtu.be/F7uZnNpPy8Y?si=_eWaPjGcvoTt24HK&t=13)) To take the passer’s [Back](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FBack).
- **Off balancing onto their hands**: To [Wrestle-up](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Transitions%2FWrestle-up), [Triangle](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FTriangle%20Choke), or take the [Back](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FBack) AOJ style.
