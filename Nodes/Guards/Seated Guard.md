# Entry
- **Guard pull**: Sit down or grab an arm then sit down.
## Guards
- [Closed Guard:](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard):
# Passing
- **Flatten the guard player**: Push them onto their back.
# Retention
- **Avoid being flattened**: Avoid being pushed to your back, otherwise it’s easier to pass your guard. If the passer tries to lift your legs, scoot your hips back.
- **Follow them**: If they circle you, follow up; make sure your legs are facing them.
## Troubleshooting
- 
# Transitioning
- **Control the ankle**: If the passer tries to pull their leg away, control the toes with your other hand and pull yourself into [50/50](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2F50-50), [Ashi](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FShin-on-Shin%20Guard), [X-guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FX-guard).
