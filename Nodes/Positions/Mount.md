# Overview
The <u>Mount</u> is one of the most dominant positions, where you’re sitting on the bottom player’s chest.

# Entry
## Positions
- [Side Control](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FSide%20Control): (1) With a cross face, walk your knees down. Bring your knee over their waist, while keeping the other knee on the toes. Walk their arm up. Bring your leg to the mat. Shelf the legs with your leg or slide into [High Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FHigh%20Mount). (2) As you’re sliding across their waist, when your knee hits the mat, hip switch, like a Long Step, and back heel your other leg. This makes it hard for the bottom player to follow you.
# Keys
- **Dynamic pinning**: Transition to different pins if the bottom player begins to escape
## Troubleshooting
- **Opponent bridges**: Your opponent can still use their hips to bridge, so monitor that.
# Transitioning
- **Elbow separation**: Separate the bottom player’s elbows from their body. Do this by pushing their arm down with a cross grip and elbow grip.
## Grips
- [[Cross Collar Grip]]:
## Positions
- [[Knee On Belly]]: Windshield wipe your legs.
- [[S-mount]]:
- [[Technical Mount]]: (1) With double underhooks, pull one arm across until you cover it with your chest. Use a kimura grip and torque to force them onto their side. 
## Submission
- [[Armbar]]: If the bottom player extends your arms.
- [[Cross Choke]]:
- [[Ezekiel Choke]]: Use this to separate the elbows.
- [[Smother Choke]]:

# Escape
- **Frames**: Use your elbows to block the top player from advancing.
- Double underhooks: When someone tries for double underhooks, shoot your hand through their armpits.
## Escapes
