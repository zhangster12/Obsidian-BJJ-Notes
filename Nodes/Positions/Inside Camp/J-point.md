# Passing
## Passes
- [[Knee Cut]]: If the guard player tracks with their bottom foot.
- [[Leg Drag]]: If they're framing.
## Positions
- [[North-South]]:
- [[Knee On Belly]]:
- [[Side Control]]: (1) If the guard player doesn’t frame, drop into [Side Control](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FSide%20Control), or (2) if they collapse their top knee, press it to the mat and walk to the other side.
# Keys
- **Elbow position**: Slightly flare your elbow to prevent the guard player from re-pummeling their leg.
- **Head position**: Immediately drive your head into their rib and tripod. Don’t wait.
- Step past the hip line.
- Control the knee while keeping the legs out of range of the hands.
- Heavy pressure on the ribs or hip.
## Troubleshooting
- 
# Escape
- If you can’t pummel your outside leg and frame at the shoulder, you can bring your knees in by pummeling underneath the passer’s armpit.
