# Overview
The <u>Technical Mount</u> is a variation of [Mount](Nodes/Positions/Mount/Mount.md) where your body is angled rather than square. One knee stays near the opponent’s hip while the other leg posts higher, near their head.

# Entry
## Positions
- [High Mount](Nodes/Positions/Mount/High Mount.md):
- [Mount](Nodes/Positions/Mount/Mount.md): Push one of the bottom player’s arm down; as they try to rescue it with their top arm, grab it with your bottom arm and bring your knee behind their head (1).
- [Side Control](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FSide%20Control): (1) Use a horse collar grip on the back of the bottom player’s neck to shuck their arm away and force them onto their side. ([2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF4PDZB2w_4)) Walk around to the other side as you block their hip.

# Escape
- **Push away the outside knee**: By pushing away the outside knee, the top player isn’t able to slide their knee forward, preventing them from advancing and chair sitting. While this prevents the top player from advancing, this leaves your upper body and neck vulnerable to attack, so to prevent this, act quickly and perform a hip escape. Dimitrius Souza does this against Nicholas Meregali at the 2023 Pan American Championship, but did not address Meregali attacking his neck, leading to a submission ([1](https://youtu.be/JBI16VajCS8?si=I-wQ9NjIgvDrk9Xy&t=231)).
