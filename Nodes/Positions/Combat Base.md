# Overview
The <u>Combat Base</u> is a position where you have one knee up and one knee down to prevent the guard from entering [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard) or avoid the [Triangle Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Nodes%2FSubmissions%2FTriangle%20Choke).

# Entry
## Guards
- [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard): Once you unlock the guard player’s legs, this prevents them from relocking them.
