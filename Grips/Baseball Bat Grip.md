# Setup
When you have the passer in [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard), and they try to stand up, you can use this grip to break down their posture and prevent them from standing up.
# Keys
You don’t need a deep grip if you’re breaking their posture.
# Attacking
In addition to breaking posture, you can use this grip to set up a [Cross Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FCross%20Choke) by sliding your one hand over their head.
