# Overview
The <u>Brabo Grip</u> is a powerful grip in the gi, in which the opponent’s lapel is controlling their posture diagonally across the back. This grip can lead to the [Brabo Choke](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Submissions%2FBrabo%20Choke) or [Cross Collar Choke](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Submissions%2FCross%20Collar%20Choke).

# Setup
This grip can be used in bottom [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXE-FfK1j0E&t=45s)
 - Breaking the opponent’s posture while pulling their lapel out.
 - Feeding under their armpit and across their back to the opposite hand.
 - Transferring the lapel back to other right hand.

Sometimes, in a match the lapel will come loose; in that case, the player doesn’t have to free the lapel.
# Keys
To make this grip difficult to escape, the player should pull the lapel **as tightly as possible** to the opponent’s neck (carotid artery) and keep their elbows tight. 

When using the <u>Brabo Grip</u> to choke, the player should flex their wrist (ulnar deviation).
# Attacking
In [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard), the bottom player can use this grip to [Cross Collar Choke](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Submissions%2FCross%20Collar%20Choke) or [Brabo Choke](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Submissions%2FBrabo%20Choke).
# Defense
In [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard), before the lapel grip is passed back to the other hand, the top player can lower their head and shrug the grip off to the side.
