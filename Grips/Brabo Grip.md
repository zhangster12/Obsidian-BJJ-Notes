# Overview
The <u>Brabo Grip</u> is a powerful grip in the gi, where you control the opponent’s lapel diagonally across the back. This can lead to the [Brabo Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FBrabo%20Choke) or [Cross Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FCross%20Choke).

# Setup
This grip can be used in [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard), [Side Control](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FSide%20Control), or [KOB](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FKnee%20On%20Belly).

In Side Control and KOB, you can pull the lapel out and wrap in behind the bottom player’s head to set up chokes.

[Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard):
- Breaking the passer’s posture while pulling their lapel out (if it’s not already free).
- Feeding it under their armpit and across their back to the opposite hand.
- Transferring the lapel back to other right hand.
# Keys
To make this grip difficult to escape, pull the lapel **as tightly as possible** to the opponent’s neck (carotid artery) and keep your elbows tight.
# Attacking
In [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard), you can use this grip to [Cross Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FCross%20Choke) or [Brabo Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FBrabo%20Choke).
# Defense
In [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard), before the lapel grip is passed back to the other hand, you can lower their head and shrug the grip off.
