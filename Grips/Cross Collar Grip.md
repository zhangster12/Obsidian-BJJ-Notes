# Overview
A <u>Cross Collar Grip</u> is a grip on the opponentâ€™s opposite collar (i.e. your right hand on their left collar).

# Setup
From [Butterfly](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FButterfly%20Guard) or [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard) or top position ([Knee Cut](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FKnee%20Cut)), you can grab the opposite side collar.
# Transitioning
In guard, the passer will strip this grip, because they recognize that a [Cross Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FCross%20Choke) is coming. You can use the momentum of the grip break to bring their arm across your midline into an [Arm Drag](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Transitions%2FArm%20Drag) or [Top Lock](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FTop%20Lock). The passer can stiff arm you to avoid having their posture broke. Grab the arm to control it to enter [Top Lock](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FTop%20Lock) or [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FArmbar).  

You can also use this set up from a [Knee Cut](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FKnee%20Cut) to [Loop Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FLoop%20Choke) when the guard player underhooks.
# Defense
You have to break the grip or intercept it before they can reach it.
