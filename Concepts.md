# Guard
## Retention
- Maintain four points of contact.
- Keep your knees to chest with your toes pointed up, and don’t overextend.
- Frames are temporary. You’re also not pushing. Frames can be short, medium, long range. Frame with your elbow.
- If you panic, control the sleeve.
## Passing
- Cook the position when optimal to fatigue the guard player.
# Other
- Never expose the triceps; chest-to-triceps connection can lead to Back takes.
- Mange chest and back connections and don’t expose both.
