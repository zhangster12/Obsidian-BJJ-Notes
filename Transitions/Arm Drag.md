# Setup
- Butterfly Guard: 
- Closed Guard: Break the passer’s posture by dropping your hips.
# Keys
- When they’re not square to you, cover their triceps with your chest.
- 
Lastly, in Butterfly and Butterfly-Half Guard, the guard player should pull the outside foot out so that they’re perpendicular to the passer as they’re dragging the arm. Additionally, Arm Drags can be executed on either side: for example, if the passer keeps their elbow tight after an attempt, the guard player can drag the opposite arm.
# Transitioning
## Positions
- [[Back]]: 
- [[Mount]]:
## Submissions
- [[Armbar]]: If the bottom player reaches for your arm, roll over their head.
## Sweeps
- [[Butterfly Sweep]]
- [[Pendulum Sweep]]: (If they try to square back in [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard) with their arm still across)
- [[Scissor Sweep]]
## Transitions
- [Butterfly Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FButterfly%20Guard) → [[Wrestle-up]]: If the <u>Arm Drag</u> fails.
# Defense
- [[Closed Guard]]: When the guard player has your sleeve griped, keep your elbow tight and stay square.
- [[Turtle]]: 
# Variations
- **2-on-1 grip**: One hand controls the passer’s wrist and the other at their sleeve.
- **Wrist/underhook grip**: One hand internally rotates their wrist, while the other hand underhooks their armpit when they separate their elbow from their hips.
