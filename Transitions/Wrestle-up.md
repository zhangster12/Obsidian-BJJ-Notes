# Overview
A <u>Wrestle-up</u> in BJJ refers to the act of transitioning from a ground position, typically when playing guard, to a standing position, ready to wrestle the opponent to the mat.

# Setup
If the passer is leaning their weight back on their far leg or upright, then Wrestling-up will be a good option to reverse position, especially if they passer is a wrestler who doesn’t want to be on their back.
# Transitioning
# Defense
The passer can lean their weight forward, but this will open them up to being off-balanced overhead.
