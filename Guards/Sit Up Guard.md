# Overview

# Entry
The guard player can can enter <u>Sit Up Guard</u> in the following ways:
- In [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva), the guard player can push the far leg away as you sit up. If the guard player is unable to reach a collar or sleeve while in [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-NotesJ-NotesJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva), sitting up will make them closer.
- Lucas Lepri sets in **Sit Up Guard** from [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva) this up by controlling the far sleeve and the DLR pants.
# Passing
# Retention
To retain <u>Sit Up Guard</u>:
- The outside arm should be elbow deep at their knee, which makes it easier to reach for a lapel. [Link](https://youtu.be/QcyeCLpw4fg?si=O2sl96PmZJFUTUkM&t=154)
- The guard player can pass the far sleeve, the belt, or the far collar to the arm that’s wrapped around for more control (gi).
# Attacking
## Sweeps
- If the guard player is using the lapel as control, then they can turn the passer like a wheel and enter [Smash Pass](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FSmash%20Pass) (gi).
- If the passer steps over the leg, then the guard player can push them over their head, frame at the triceps, and [Wrestle-up](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Transitions%2FWrestle-up).
