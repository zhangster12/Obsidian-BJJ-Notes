# Entry
## Guards
- [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva): (1) Push the far leg away as you sit up. If you can’t reach a collar or sleeve while in [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-NotesJ-NotesJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva), sitting up will make them closer. (2) Control the far sleeve.

# Retention
- **Arm position**: ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcyeCLpw4fg&t=154s)) Your outside arm should be elbow deep at their knee, which makes it easier to reach for a lapel.
- **Gi control**: Pass the far sleeve, the belt, or the far collar to the arm around the knee for more control (gi).
## Troubleshooting
- 
# Transitions
## Passes
- [[Smash Pass]]: Use the lapel to turn the passer like a wheel to end up in top position.
## Transitions
- [[Wrestle-up]]: If the passer steps over your leg, push them over your head and frame at the triceps.
