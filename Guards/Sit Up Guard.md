# Entry
You can enter **Sit Up Guard** in the following ways:
- In [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva), you can push the far leg away as you sit up. If you’re unable to reach a collar or sleeve in [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-NotesJ-NotesJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva), this is a good option.
- Lucas Lepri sets in **Sit Up Guard** from [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva) this up by controlling the far sleeve and the DLR pants.
# Passing

# Retention
To retain **Sit Up Guard**:
- The outside arm should be elbow deep at their knee. This also makes it easier to reach for a lapel. [Link](https://youtu.be/QcyeCLpw4fg?si=O2sl96PmZJFUTUkM&t=154)

In the gi, you can pass the far sleeve, the belt, or the far collar to the arm that’s wrapped around for more control.
