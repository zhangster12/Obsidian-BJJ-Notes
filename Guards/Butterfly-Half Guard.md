# Overview
<u>Butterfly-Half Guard</u> is a variation of [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard), where your outside foot is hooked onto the inside of the passer’s thigh, making this a hybrid of [Butterfly](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FButterfly%20Guard) and [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard).

# Entry
## Guards
- [Butterfly Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FButterfly%20Guard): Hook one foot inside the passer’s legs.
- [Chest-to-Chest Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FChest-to-Chest%20Half%20Guard): Hook the outside foot onto the passer’s thigh.
- [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard): Hook the outside foot onto the passer’s thigh.
## Sweeps
- [Lever Sweep](the outside foot onto the passer’s thigh.): If the passer doesn’t give up position, hook the outside foot onto their thigh.
# Passing
- [[Tripod Pass]]: Pin in the non-hooked leg; if the guard player tries to elevate you, then it won’t be as effective, and they’re pushing you to pass in the pinned side.
# Retention
- Protect your collar or head by monitoring the far arm.
# Transitioning
## Guards
- [[Ashi Garami]]: Grab the outside knee and collar, and pull them on top. Shoot the inside knee through, grab the pants/foot, and bring the elbow inside to elevate the foot (like a waiter).
- [[Butterfly Guard]]: Pull the inside foot out.
## Sweeps
- [[Butterfly Sweep]]: (1) Pull the inside foot out and bring it outside the knee. Drive your head into their chin, pull them onto you, and turn their body as you sweep. (2) With a Collar and Sleeve Grip, pull them onto you, post onto the elbow (Sleeve Grip). Upgrade to an Overback Grip (formerly Collar Grip) and Overhook (formerly Sleeve Grip). Pull the bottom leg out and sweep.
## Transitions
- [[Arm Drag]]
# Defense
- If the passer tripods, grab their foot.
