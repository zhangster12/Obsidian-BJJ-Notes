# Overview
<u>Butterfly-Half Guard</u> is a variation of [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard), where the outside foot is hooked onto the inside of the passer’s thigh, making this a hybrid of [Butterfly](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FButterfly%20Guard) and [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard).

# Entry/Setup
# Passing
If you’re chest-to-chest, then pin the non-hooking leg; that way, if the guard player is trying to elevate you, then it won’t be as effective, and they’re pushing you to pass in the pinned side.
# Retention
Similar to regular [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard), protect your collar or head by monitoring the far arm.
# Attacking
- [Ashi](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FAshi%20Garami): Grab the outside knee and collar, and pull them on top. Shoot the inside knee through, grab the pants/foot, and bring the elbow inside to elevate the foot (like a waiter).
- [Butterfly Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FButterfly%20Sweep): Pull the inside foot out and bring it outside the knee. Drive your head into their chin, pull them onto you, and turn their body as you sweep.
- [Butterfly Sweep 2](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FButterfly%20Sweep): With a Collar and Sleeve Grip, pull them onto you, post onto the elbow (Sleeve Grip). Upgrade to an Overback Grip (formerly Collar Grip) and Overhook (formerly Sleeve Grip). Pull the bottom leg out and sweep. (gi)
# Defense
