# Overview

<u>Butterfly-Half Guard</u> is a variation of [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard), in which the outside foot is hooked onto the inside of the top playerâ€™s thigh, making this a hybrid of [Butterfly](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FButterfly%20Guard) and [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard).

# Entry/Setup
# Passing
# Retention
Similar to regular [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard), the guard player should protect their collar or head by monitoring the far arm.
# Attacking
The guard player can enter Ashi, by grabbing the outside knee and collar pulling them on top. They can then shoot the inside knee through, grab the pants/foot, and bring the elbow inside to elevate the foot (like a waiter).
