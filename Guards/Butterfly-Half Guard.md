# Overview

<u>Butterfly-Half Guard</u> is a variation of [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard), in which the outside foot is hooked onto the inside of the top playerâ€™s thigh, making this a hybrid of [Butterfly](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FButterfly%20Guard) and [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard).

# Entry/Setup
# Passing
# Retention
Similar to regular [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard), protect your collar or head by monitoring the far arm.
Bring your head underneath their head.
# Attacking
- [Ashi](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FAshi%20Garami): You can enter [Ashi](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FAshi%20Garami), by grabbing the outside knee and collar pulling them on top. They can then shoot the inside knee through, grab the pants/foot, and bring the elbow inside to elevate the foot (like a waiter).
- [Butterfly Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FButterfly%20Sweep): Your foot is already on the outside, which makes it easier to begin the sweep. Drive your head into their chin, pull them onto you, and turn their body.
- [Turtle](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FTurtle): If you pull down on their head and technical stand up, you force them 
- **Backwards sweep**: If they have their weight back, it will be difficult to complete the [Butterfly Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FButterfly%20Sweep); therefore you can sweep them backwards by technical standing up, as you push forwards.
