# Overview
The <u>Closed Guard</u> is when the legs are hooked behind the opponent, preventing them from standing up or moving away.

# Entry
When pulling guard, if the opponent leaves their knee-elbow space open, you can shoot your legs through.
# Passing
All passes from the <u>Closed Guard</u> will involve opening the legs and most of the time controlling and pinning the hips. The 1 exception to this is the [Sao Paulo Pass](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passing%2FSao%20Paulo%20Pass), in which you’re actively maintaining a low posture.

There are multiple ways to open the legs:
- From the knees, after the hips have been pinned, you can blade your stance and force 1 knee into their butt. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yhy-QVscGq8)
- Similarly, you can do this from standing, with your arms at their armpits or gi. [Link](https://youtu.be/FChiT98_Cgg?si=Q61MCzsMIr4SQNZY&t=214)
# Retention
Breaking posture is the basis of all attacks from **Closed Guard**. The opponent would want to maintain posture.

In the gi, there are ways to break grips:
- There’s the Roger Gracie way.

There are multiple ways to break posture:
- If their hands are on you but not gripping anything, teepee your hands up and out, while simultaneously bringing your legs towards you.
- With a collar grip, you can time bringing your legs to your chest as they stand up.

Similarly, there are multiple ways to control posture:
- In the gi, can grab your own gi lapel and feed it over their head for more control.
- Additionally, you can climb the back.

Climbing the back will allow you to have upper body control:
- Climb the back 1 leg at a time while breaking their posture with a collar grip/collar tie.
- You can also control an arm (triceps grip, wrist grip). Once you control an arm, if you open your legs just a little and bring them to you, you can have greater upper body control. You will hit their arms. Then the only way for them to escape is to drive forward, which makes the [Pendulum Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FPendulum%20Sweep) assessable.
# Attacking
In the <u>Closed Guard</u>, attacking is based on their elbow, hand, and posture positions:
- If their posture is high, then you could attempt a [Hip Bump Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FHip%20Bump%20Sweep). To set it up, you could break their posture, and as they try to posture up, you can attempt the sweep.
- If their hands are on your chest, then they are not on your legs/pants. You can freely move your legs.

Additionally, if you break their posture, the opponent will want to posture up, or if you attempt an [Arm Drag](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Transitions%2FArm%20Drag), they will square up.

You can begin a setup for everything with a [Cross Collar Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FCross%20Collar%20Choke), as they will need to defend it.

If they stand up with both of their legs near you, you can grab them and sweep. By pushing on the hips or Muscle Sweep.
