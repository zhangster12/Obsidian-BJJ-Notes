# Overview
The <u>Closed Guard</u> is when the passer is locked between your legs, preventing them from moving away.

# Entry
## Guards
- [Supine Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FSupine%20Guard): If the passer is passing from their knees, and leaves their knee-elbow-space open, shoot your legs through. Use one leg at a time; while maintaining a hip bridge, plant one leg onto their back, then the other.
## Escapes
- [[Bridge & Roll Escape]]: If you’re swept from [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount).
## Sweeps
- [Butterfly Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FButterfly%20Sweep): Shoot your legs through the knee-elbow space.
# Passing
- **Avoid <u>Closed Guard</u>**: Otherwise you can’t attack.
- **Open the guard**: Escape the hip, knees, and ankles, then disconnect.
- **Tight elbows**: Otherwise it’s easy for the guard player to attack you.
- **Pin the hips**: Maintain high posture and blade your stance or your leg will be in the way. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yhy-QVscGq8)
- **Create discomfort**: While standing/kneeling, drive your knee into their butt. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yhy-QVscGq8), [Link 2](https://youtu.be/FChiT98_Cgg?si=Q61MCzsMIr4SQNZY&t=214)
- **Hand position**: (1) Pushing the leg down is easier standing, because they’re hanging on by their feet. (2) Bring one arm inside their legs to throw it over.
## Guards
- [[Open Guard]]: When you open and escape the guard, then work to pass the ankles, knees, and hips.
## Passes
- [[Sao Paulo Pass]]: Pin an arm to the mat.
## Positions
- [[Combat Base]]: Knee one knee up, one knee down to prevent the guard player from locking their legs.
# Retention
- **Keep the guard closed**: Make it impossible for the passer to open the guard when they’re kneeling and prevent them from standing up. If they do stand up, break them back down. When they’re kneeling vs. standing, it’s easier for you to use your legs.
- **Breaking grips**: Use two arms vs. their one arm. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJO4GClV8V8)
- **Break their posture**: Crunch your legs as you pull them towards you. (1) Teepee your hand up and up, (2) flare their elbows, or (3) pull them towards up as they stand up. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_oDvBRzOJ5A)
- **Control their posture**: (1) Control inside position. Use a [Cross Collar Grip](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Grips%2FCross%20Collar%20Grip) under their arms and glue your arm to them. (2) Climb the back to control their upper body.  [Link](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/oZ8o_STXl84)
- **Constantly be attacking**. Begin setups with [Cross Collar Grip](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Grips%2FCross%20Collar%20Grip).
## Troubleshooting
- If the passer stiff arms your hips or chest to prevent their posture from being broken down, (1) use a [Baseball Bat Grip](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Grips%2FBaseball%20Bat%20Grip) on their collar and over their arm to bend their elbow, and as they stand up, pull them down using your legs and core. (2) When they blade their stance, lift your hips and shoulder walk to square back up with them.
# Transitioning
- **Elbows, hands, and posture**: (1) If the passer’s hands are on your chest, you can move your legs freely. (2) If their hands are on the mat, attack [Clamp Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClamp%20Guard), [Kimura](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FKimura), [Hip Bump Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FHip%20Bump%20Sweep). (3) If their elbow is past your midline, attack [Arm Drag](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Transitions%2FArm%20Drag), [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FArmbar), [Top Lock](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FTop%20Lock). (3) If they’re postured high, attack [Hip Bump Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FHip%20Bump%20Sweep). (4) If their weight is loaded on you, attack [Pendulum Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FPendulum%20Sweep).
- **Opposite actions**: They’ll do the opposite of what you do. For example, if you break their posture, they will do the opposite and posture up.

## Sweeps

## Transitions

# Variations
- **With overhook**: You have an overhook on one of the passer’s arms
- **Legs around back**: Your legs are wrapped around their back rather than their hips. When you control an arm, the only way for them to escape is to drive forward, which leads to Arm Drag or [Pendulum Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FPendulum%20Sweep).
