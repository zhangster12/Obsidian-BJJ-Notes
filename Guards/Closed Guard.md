# Overview
The <u>Closed Guard</u> is a guard where the passer is locked between the guard player’s legs, preventing the passer from moving away.

# Entry
After pulling guard, if the passer leaves their knee-elbow space open, you can shoot your legs through that space and lock them.
- Use one leg at a time; while maintaining a hip bridge, plant one leg onto their back, then the other.

The top player can also be swept from [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) into <u>Closed Guard</u>.
# Passing
Your objective is to avoid being put into <u>Closed Guard</u>, as it’s a difficult position to be put in. There are few attacks from the top, as they will open you to the guard player’s attacks.

Opening the guard is passing [Open Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FOpen%20Guard) in reverse: you have to escape the hips, knees, and ankles, then pass the ankles, knees, and hips. Here are some main ideas:
- Pinning the hips and maintaining posture.
- Blading your stance or your leg will be in the way when you push the guard player’s leg down.
- Bringing one arm inside their legs to throw a leg over.
- Pushing the leg down is easier from standing, because they’re essentially hanging on by their feet.
## Passes
Kneeling (one or both knees are on the mat):
- Pinning the hips and blading the stance to wedge one knee into the guard player’s butt. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yhy-QVscGq8)
- Pinning an arm to the mat and [Sao Paolo Pass](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passing%2FSao%20Paulo%20Pass).

Standing:
- Wedging one knee into the butt with the arms in the armpits or gi. [Link](https://youtu.be/FChiT98_Cgg?si=Q61MCzsMIr4SQNZY&t=214)
# Retention
Before attacking with submissions, you have to first maintain <u>Closed Guard</u>; this involves making it impossible for the passer to open the guard while they’re kneeling, preventing them from standing up, and if they do stand up, breaking the passer back down to the kneeling position. When the passer is kneeling in <u>Closed Guard</u>, you can use your legs more effectively, but when they stand up, you are less effectively able to maintain the guard, so you must sweep or switch to a different guard. Therefore, don’t rush to open the guard.

If the passer stiff arms your hips or chest to prevent their posture from being broken down and stand up, you have to break down their posture:
- Use **baseball bat grip** on their collar and over their arm; this forces a bend in their elbow. As they stand up, pull them down using your legs and core.
- When they blade their stance to stand up, lift your hips, shoulder walk , and square back up with them. If a knee is up, try to underhook it for a [Pendulum Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FPendulum%20Sweep).

Breaking posture is the basis of all attacks from Closed Guard. The opponent would want to maintain posture.

In the gi, there are ways to break grips:
- There’s the Roger Gracie way.

Breaking posture:
- If their hands are on you but not gripping anything, teepee your hands up and out, while simultaneously bringing your legs towards you.
- With a collar grip, you can time bringing your legs to your chest as they stand up.

Controling posture:
- In the gi, can grab your own gi lapel and feed it over their head for more control.
- Additionally, you can climb the back.

Climbing the back will allow you to have upper body control:
- Climb the back 1 leg at a time while breaking their posture with a collar grip/collar tie.
- You can also control an arm (triceps grip, wrist grip). Once you control an arm, if you open your legs just a little and bring them to you, you can have greater upper body control. You will hit their arms. Then the only way for them to escape is to drive forward, which makes the [Pendulum Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FPendulum%20Sweep) assessable.
# Attacking
On the bottom, you should be constantly attacking.

In the <u>Closed Guard</u>, attacking is based on the passer’s elbow, hand, and posture positions:
- If their posture is high, then you could attempt a [Hip Bump Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FHip%20Bump%20Sweep). To set it up, you could break their posture, and as they try to posture up, you can attempt the sweep.
- If their hands are on your chest, then they are not on your legs/pants. You can freely move your legs.

Additionally, if you break their posture, the opponent will want to posture up, or if you attempt an [Arm Drag](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Transitions%2FArm%20Drag), they will square up.

You can begin a setup for everything with a [Cross Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FCross%20Choke), as they will need to defend it. They will naturally use an arm on your chest to prevent you from reaching for a collar.

For an arm bar, the top player will keep them close to prvent to be able to bend their arm.

If they stand up with both of their legs near you, you can grab them and sweep. By pushing on the hips or Muscle Sweep.
