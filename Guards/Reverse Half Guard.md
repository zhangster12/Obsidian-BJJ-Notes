# Entry
## Guards
- [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard): (1) Hip switch or (2) if the guard player attempts to underhook, sit back on your heels, frame at their neck, then hip switch. They won’t have a strong underhook and their hand will be in your armpit.
## Passes
- [Knee Cut](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FKnee%20Cut): Get your knee to the mat and back step.
# Passing
- **Stay on your toes**: Drive all pressure into the guard player’s chest and shoulders, which makes it very hard for them to sweep.
- **Use your knee**: Wedge your bottom leg into their hip. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/h15KxpW-fBA)
