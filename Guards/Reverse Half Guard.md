# Entry

If the bottom player attempts an underhook (if the top player is past the knee), the top player must sit their heels to butt while keeping their elbow tight and framing at the bottom player’s neck. The bottom player’s will not be able to have a strong underhook and their hand will be at the top player’s armpit. From there, the top player will drop to their hip (like a [Long Step](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passing%2FLong%20Step)).
# Passing
In <u>Reverse Half Guard</u>, if the top player can isolate the near side arm for a [Kimura](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FKimura), that can assist in passing.

Additionally, the top player can free their leg by wedging their bottom leg into the bottom player’s hip. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/h15KxpW-fBA) 
# Retention
- Stay on your toes.
- Drive all pressure into the guard player’s chest and shoulders. As long as the pressure is their chest and shoulders, then it will be very hard for them to sweep.
# Attacking
In <u>Reverse Half Guard</u>, the top player can isolate an arm and attack a [Kimura](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FKimura).
# Defense
Although crossing the legs would slow down the passer, you need to get your legs back in front.
