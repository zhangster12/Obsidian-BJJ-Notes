# Entry
- [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard): Get an underhook and sit up from bottom position.
# Passing
- [[Reverse Half Guard]]: Before the guard player can extract their leg, pull their bottom arm towards you. Then, free your leg. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjMRT2jCbY)
# Retention
- When you’re switching hooks on the guard player’s leg, do it in one motion (place your inside foot with your outside hook simultaneously).
- To keep control of their foot, back heel as far as you can, then turn your knee down. This places their hip at an awkward angle and your weight on them, making your leg light to extract.
## Troubleshooting
- If you’re having trouble moving the passer’s weight, knee them in the butt.
# Transitioning
## Passes
- [[Leg Drag]]: If you’re having a hard time driving forward, move back, pull the nearside foot into your hip, then drive forward. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/9hFyCb6QHVM)
## Positions
- [[Back]]: Shrug the whizzer off.
## Sweeps
- [[Ankle Pick Sweep]]: Pull the guard player’s far ankle towards you as you drive forward. Control the ankle at their toes.
- [[Knee Tap Sweep]]: Block their far knee as you drive forward to complete the sweep.
- [[Rollover Sweep]]: Pull the far leg as you roll onto your shoulder.
# Defense
- Place a whizzer to prevent the guard player from taking your [Back](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FBack).
# Variations
- **Underhook at the hip**: 
- **Underhook at the thigh**: This makes it harder for the passer to whizzer.
