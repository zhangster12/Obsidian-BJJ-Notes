# Overview
The **X-guard** is a position in which you have your same side hand gripping over the top of their knee, while 1 of your legs hooks behind their other knee, while your other foot is up by their hip.

# Entry
From [Ashi](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FAshi%20Garami), you can enter **X-guard** when the opponent strips the top foot.
# Passing
# Retention
# Attacking
If you have 1 hook at the hook and lower the other hook to the foot, you can perform a [Tripod Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FTripod%20Sweep). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SkgNz0iwbw)

Get top player’s hands to mat then 2 pant grips.
Wrestle up to leg drag.
# Variations
## Modified
In the modified **X-guard**, sometimes called the butterfly-x guard, the top leg is hooking at the near side hip for control. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YiH8ggmM4I&t=11s)
## Single-leg X
The single-leg X is similar to [Ashi](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FAshi%20Garami), but it’s different in that it only controls the hip of the near side leg and not the far side.
