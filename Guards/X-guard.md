# Overview
The <u>X-guard</u> is a guard in which the guard player’s legs are controlling a passer’s leg like an X.

# Entry
From [Ashi](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FAshi%20Garami), you can enter <u>X-guard</u> when the opponent strips the top foot.
# Passing
- **Pull up on the sleeve**: Don’t pull on the sleeve that’s controlling your ankle.
- **Break down the hooks**: Push down on the guard player’s legs so they aren’t hooked.
# Retention
- Constantly off-balance the passer:
- Keep sticky hooks:
# Attacking
You should keep the passer’s hands on the mat or away by off balancing them.

## Sweeps
- If the guard player has 1 hook at the hip and lower the other hook to the foot, they can perform a [Tripod Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FTripod%20Sweep). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SkgNz0iwbw)
- After getting the passer’s hands to the mat, the guard player can grab 2 pant grips and [Wrestle up](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Transitions%2FWrestle-up): Get their hand’s to the mat, grab 2 pants
- The guard player can bring their knees to the chest and push the passer onto their back.
# Variations
 
## Modified
In the modified **X-guard**, sometimes called the butterfly-x guard, the top leg is hooking at the near side hip for control. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YiH8ggmM4I&t=11s)
## Single-leg X
The single-leg X is similar to [Ashi](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FAshi%20Garami), but it’s different in that it only controls the hip of the near side leg and not the far side.
