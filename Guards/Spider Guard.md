# Entry
Entering Spider Guard usually happens when you can control of both of the opponent’s sleeves. This can happen in the following ways:
- In [Supine Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FSupine%20Guard), if they reach for your pants, you can grab their sleeves.
- In Closed Guard, the guard player can control both sleeves, then bring the feet to the hips and flare the knees out. Then plant the feet on the biceps.
# Passing
# Retention
You need to be on 1 hip and have 1 leg extended.

Plant 1 foot on mat arms to face
→ X guard


If they squat down with 1 knee up and the other back:

Deep DLR X

If theirs no space under the knee: shin on shin
extend and enter ashi, triangle, or closed guard
# Attacking
From bruce spider guard workshop
Sweeps
- Bring the other foot to the knee.
- Steer them to the knee side for the sweep.
- Lasso option
    - From the lasso, bring the opposite leg on the same side and let go of the opposite arm.
    - When they try to go into side control, grab their pants. Flare the lasso knee out and simultaneously throw them over.
Submissions
- If they bring their leg up, bridge up to go into a triangle.
- For when the lasso option doesn’t work:
    - Triangle the arm, and pull the arm over the chest.
    - Pull down on the biceps (with 2 hands on either side), and press the calf into the bicep.
Back Take
- If the bicep slicer doesn’t work:
    - Throw the arms and kick over, and take the back.
