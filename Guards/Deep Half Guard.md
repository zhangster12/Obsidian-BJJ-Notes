# Entry
## Guards
- [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard): Underhook the passer’s leg, rolling their hamstring behind your head.
# Passing
## Guards
- [[Chest-to-Chest Half Guard]]: Underhook the passer’s arm.
# Retention

- **Control the leg**: This keeps them unstable.
