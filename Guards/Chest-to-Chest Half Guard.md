# Entry
- As a passer, you can pommel your arms for underhooks.
# Passing
- Tripod Pass: Flare the elbows, tripod up, use a butterfly hook to free your leg to pass into Side Control or Mount. When passing to Mount, separate the guard player’s knees and elbows, or they can sweep you.
- **Passing to the side**: Walk yourself 45 deg away from them, then push their legs away as you drive forward.
# Keys to Passing
- Chest-to-chest is a very good position, because you can pin the opponent without passing. To pass:

# Transitioning

# Counter
- Lever Sweep:
- Butterfly-Half:
- Butterfly Guard: If the pass has double underhooks and Tripods, then follow their knee until there’s enough space for Butterfly hooks.
# Variations
There are different ways to control the upper body:
- **Head & arm**: One arm is the underhook, while the other one is the crossface.
- **Double underhooks**: Push the other arm down and swim your arm underneath.
- **High Body Lock**: Connect your hands behind the guard player’s head while using double underhooks.
