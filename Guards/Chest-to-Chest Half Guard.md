# Overview
<u>Chest-to-Chest Half Guard</u> is a variation of [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard), where you’re chest-to-chest with the guard player; this makes it easy to pin them without passing.

# Entry
- [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard): Pommel your arms for underhooks.
# Passing
## Grips
- [[Brabo Grip]]: Use the grip to force the passer’s elbow open so you can underhook.
## Guards
- [[Reverse Half Guard]]:
## Passes
- [[Tripod Pass]]: (1) Flare the elbows, tripod up, use a hook to free your leg to pass into [Side Control](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FSide%20Control) or [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount). When passing to [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount), separate the guard player’s knees and elbows, or they can sweep you. (2) Walk yourself 45 deg away from them, then push their legs away as you drive forward.
# Retention
- Frame across the passer’s neck.
# Counter
## Guards
- [[Butterfly Guard]]: If the passer has double underhooks and uses the [Tripod Pass](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FTripod%20Pass), follow their knee until there’s enough space for hooks.
- [[Butterfly-Half Guard]]: Hook your outside foot on their thigh.
## Sweeps
- [[Lever Sweep]]: Trap the arm and push on the hip.
# Variations
## Upper Body
- **Head & arm**: One arm is the underhook, while the other one is the crossface.
- **Double underhooks**: Push the other arm down and swim your arm underneath.
- **High Body Lock**: Connect your hands behind the guard player’s head while using double underhooks.
