# Entry
## Guards
- [Supine Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FSupine%20Guard): If the passer is controlling your legs while their feet are back, grab their sleeves and plant your feet onto their upper body.
# Passing
- **Inside control**: Pummel your outside arm inside their outside leg.
## Passes
- 
# Retention
- **Raise your hips**: To follow the passer.
- **Pinch your knees**: To control their arm.
## Troubleshooting
- **Passer retracts arm**: Use a ratchet motion on their arm by using your knee as a wedge.
- **Break posture**: If theyâ€™re standing, put their arm into your pocket to lower their level.
# Transitioning
## Guards
- [[De La Riva]]: If the passer steps their leg forward.
- [[Lasso Guard]]:
- [[Spider Guard]]:
## Transitions
- [[Arm Drag]]: If the passer is driving into you, transfer the sleeve to your other hand and the triceps to your original hand. Drag their arm across, while you kick your bottom leg.
- [[Collar Drag]]: Similarly to [Arm Drag](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Transitions%2FArm%20Drag), retain control of the collar to drag the arm across. 
## Submissions
- [[Omoplata]]:
- [[Triangle Choke]]:
## Sweeps
 - [[Tripod Sweep]]:
# Variations
- **Foot on shoulder**: Planting the foot on the shoulder is the more basic variation.
- **Foot on bicep**: Planting the top foot on the bicep makes it harder for the passer to swim their arm inside and allows you to monitor the arm.
