# Overview
The <u>Collar Sleeve Guard</u> is characterized by collar and sleeve control. This allows you to control the upper body of the passer, making it easier to use kuzushi by pulling the gi towards them.

# Entry
- If the passer is controlling your legs with their hands while their feet are back, you can grab their sleeves and start planting your feet onto their upper body.
# Passing
- Pummel your outside arm inside the leg that’s controlling the shoulder/bicep.
- 
# Retention
- Raise your hips.
- Pinch your knees.
- Prevent the passer from retracting their arm; use a ratchet motion on their arm by using your knee as a wedge when they do attempt to retract it.
- If they’re standing, put their arm into your pocket to make them lever their level.
# Attacking

- [Omoplata](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FOmoplata):
# Variations
- **Foot on shoulder**: Planting the foot on the shoulder is the more basic variation.
- **Foot on bicep**: Planting the top foot on the bicep makes it harder for the passer to swim their arm inside and allows you to monitor the arm.
