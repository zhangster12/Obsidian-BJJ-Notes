# Entry
- If the passer is controlling your legs with their hands while their feet are back, you can grab their sleeves and start planting your feet onto their upper body.
# Passing
- Pummel your outside arm inside the leg that’s controlling the shoulder/bicep.
# Retention
- Raise your hips.
- Pinch your knees.
- Prevent the passer from retracting their arm; use a ratchet motion on their arm by using your knee as a wedge when they do attempt to retract it.
- If they’re standing, put their arm into your pocket to make them lever their level.
# Transitioning
## Guards
- [[De La Riva]]: If the passer steps forward, they’re giving you that leg, so you can hook outside of it.
- [[Lasso Guard]]
- [[Spider Guard]]
## Positions
- [[Back]]: If the passer is driving into you, transfer their sleeve from your left to right hand, while your left hand controls their triceps. Perform an arm drag to the right while kicking your left leg out.
## Submissions
- [[Omoplata]]
- [[Triangle Choke]]
## Sweeps
 - [[Tripod Sweep]]
# Variations
- **Foot on shoulder**: Planting the foot on the shoulder is the more basic variation.
- **Foot on bicep**: Planting the top foot on the bicep makes it harder for the passer to swim their arm inside and allows you to monitor the arm.
