# Overview
The <u>Collar Sleeve Guard</u> is characterized by collar and sleeve control. This allows you to control the upper body of the passer, making it easier to use kuzushi by pulling the gi towards you.

# Entry
- [Supine Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FSupine%20Guard): If the passer is controlling your legs while their feet are back, grab their sleeves and plant your feet onto their upper body.
# Passing
- Pummel your outside arm inside the leg that’s controlling the shoulder/bicep.
## Passes
- 
# Retention
- **Raise your hips**: This allows you to follow the passer.
- **Pinch your knees**: This allows you to control their arm.
- **Prevent them from retracting their arm**: use a ratchet motion on their arm by using your knee as a wedge when they do attempt to retract it.
- If they’re standing, put their arm into your pocket to make them lever their level.
# Transitioning
## Guards
- [[De La Riva]]: If the passer steps forward, their leg is within reach, so you can hook it.
- [[Lasso Guard]]
- [[Spider Guard]]
## Positions
- [[Arm Drag]]: If the passer is driving into you, transfer the sleeve to your other hand and the triceps to your original hand. Drag their arm across, while you kick your bottom leg.
- [[Collar Drag]]: Similarly to [Arm Drag](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Transitions%2FArm%20Drag), retain control of the collar to drag the arm across. 
## Submissions
- [[Omoplata]]
- [[Triangle Choke]]
## Sweeps
 - [[Tripod Sweep]]
# Variations
- **Foot on shoulder**: Planting the foot on the shoulder is the more basic variation.
- **Foot on bicep**: Planting the top foot on the bicep makes it harder for the passer to swim their arm inside and allows you to monitor the arm.
