# Overview
**De La Riva (DLR)** is a guard in which you have one foot hooked on their hip.

# Entry
Entering **DLR** occurs in open guard when the opponent steps one leg forward, which presents an opportunity to hook onto the leg. For example, in [Collar Sleeve](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Guards%2FCollar%20Sleeve%20Guard), when the opponent steps forwards to remove the frames, you can swing around to hook onto the leg.
# Passing
When passing **DLR**, you have to kill the hook by extending your leg, so it’s very hard to hook onto. For the other leg, control the leg so that it’s not framing and squat on top of it. If the person on the bottom strips the grips, you can force half guard.

If they’re lazy with the hook, you can just push it down.

To pass Nick and Danny’s variation ([[#^d023b6]]), you would first turn your other knee in so that you’re facing them. Plant your knee in the back of their thigh. Then you would strip the hook by reaching under their other leg and pushing the hook down and driving your knee in. If they push back you can go to HQ.
# Retention
The hooked knee should be turned in, so the opponent is unable to remove the hook easily. The opponent would turn their knee out to remove the hook. Your other leg should be used as a frame on their far hip or their knee.

The foot that is hooking should be tight and flexed and be very close to the hips. [Link](https://youtu.be/QcyeCLpw4fg?si=-JFcrw1eaK9h-t-b&t=43)

If you are too close to their foot, this can prevent you from establish a strong hook. To fix this, simply shoulder walk yourself away while framing on their foot.

They taught a variation of **DLR** in which you are a little more square to the opponent, and they emphasized a few details:
- Keeping the knees pointing up towards the ceiling, so they when the opponent tries to remove them, it’s difficult.
- The foot that is framing is on the hip to prevent them from stepping over.
- A light collar grip so you can adjust your body position depending on if they posture up or crouch. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/02jQ2CylttM)
# Attacking
In **DLR**, you have to constantly off balancing the opponent to prevent them from getting their grips to start passing. When their hands are on the mat, then you can start attacking.
## Sweeping
When you begin to off balance, you first always have to bring your knees to the chest.

Ways to off balance:
- Hooking or framing on the far thigh, bring them close, then away, while grabbing onto the collar. [[#^fb9732]]

Sweeping to the hooked leg side:
- If they step back to remove the frame, you can bring your knees to your chest, and off balance to the hooked leg side.

**If they step the far foot close enough for you to reach**, then you can grab it and pull it towards you to assist in sweeping. Here are some ways to force them to take that step as well:
- Cross your feet (**DLR** hook under the other foot), pinch the knees, and turn yourself in the direction.
- Deep DLR hook.
If they can post you can push on the hip and go into mount (Test this out)

Sweeping overhead:
- You can off balance them overhead, and take their [Back](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Positions%2FBack). [Link](https://youtu.be/F7uZnNpPy8Y?si=_eWaPjGcvoTt24HK&t=13)
If you off balance them away from the hooked leg: ^fb9732
- [Wrestle-up](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Transitions%2FWrestle-up) then progress into a [Single Leg](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Takedowns%2FSingle%20Leg. [Link](https://youtu.be/F7uZnNpPy8Y?si=_eWaPjGcvoTt24HK&t=13).
- You can also [Triangle](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Submissions%2FTriangle%20Choke), since you can isolate a head and arm. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEGGBDJRTaw)
- Lastly you can take the Back either AOJ style or Crab Ride.
# Variations
## Reverse DLR
In Reverse DLR, 
## Deep DLR-X
Sometimes in DLR, they take a back step and their far foot ends up near you.

The one downside is that it locks you into sweeping.

Keep frame on near side arm.
## Grip Variations
### Pant Grip (Gi)
This variation only works in the gi. You grab the pants.
### Underhook
Rather than a foot or pant grip, you underhook their leg.

This helps with off balancing
### Bicep Grip
In this variation, you are framing the far foot on the far bicep.
