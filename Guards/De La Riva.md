# Entry

## Guards
- [Collar Sleeve](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FCollar%20Sleeve%20Guard):
- [Spider Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FSpider%20Guard):
# Passing
- Kill the hook by (1) extending your leg, (2) pushing it down, or (3) reaching under your own leg to push the hook down. To prevent the guard player from re-hooking, turn your knee out and drive it in.
- Drive your other knee into their thigh of their other leg.
## Guards
- [[Half Guard]]: If the guard player strips your grips.
## Passes
- [[Knee Cut]]:
- [[Leg Drag]]:
## Positions
- [[Headquarters]]: (1) Control the leg on your hip and squat on it or (2) if the passer pushes back.
# Retention
- **<u>DLR</u> Hook**: Turn your hooked knee in or pointed towards the ceiling to make it difficult to remove. Keep the foot flexed by the hip.
- **Distance management**: Frame on the hip (or hook onto their other leg) with your other leg.
- **Upper body control**: Use a [Cross Collar Grip](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Grips%2FCross%20Collar%20Grip) to adjust your body position depending on if they posture up or crouch. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/02jQ2CylttM).
- **Kuzushi**: Constantly off balance the passer to prevent them from getting grips to pass and attack when their hands are on the mat.
## Troubleshooting
- **Too close to foot**: Shoulder walk yourself away while framing on the passer’s foot, or you won’t be able to establish a strong hook.
- **Off balancing**: Bring your knees to your chest first, then float them away, while framing on the hip and with a Cross Collar Grip.
- **Far foot too far**: If their foot is too far to grab, (1) cross your feet, pinch the knees, and turn yourself in the direction. (2) Use a Deep DLR hook.
# Transitioning
