# Overview
<u>De La Riva</u> (<u>DLR</u>) is when you have one foot hooked outside the passer’s leg.

# Entry
- When the passer steps forward with one leg.
## Guards
- [Collar Sleeve](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FCollar%20Sleeve%20Guard)
- [Spider Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FSpider%20Guard)
# Passing
- Kill the hook by (1) extending your leg, (2) pushing it down, or (3) reaching under your own leg to push the hook down. To prevent the guard player from re-hooking, turn your knee out and drive it in.
- Drive your other knee into their thigh of their other leg.
## Guards
- [[Half Guard]]: If the guard player strips your grips.
## Positions
- [[Headquarters]]: (1) Control the leg on your hip and squat on it or (2) if the passer pushes back.
# Retention
- **<u>DLR</u> Hook**: Turn your hooked knee in or pointed towards the ceiling to make it difficult to remove. Keep the foot flexed by the hip.
- **Distance management**: Frame on the hip (or hook onto their other leg) with your other leg.
- **Upper body control**: Use [Cross Collar Grip](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Grips%2FCross%20Collar%20Grip) to adjust your body position depending on if they posture up or crouch. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/02jQ2CylttM).
- **Kuzushi**: Constantly off balancing the passer to prevent them from getting grips to pass and attack when their hands are on the mat.
## Troubleshooting
- If you’re too close to the passer’s foot, you won’t be able to establish a strong hook, so shoulder walk yourself away while framing on their foot.
# Transitioning
## Submissions
- [[Triangle Choke]]:
## Sweeps
- [[Split Sweep]]
- [[Tripod Sweep]]
## Transitions
- [[Wrestle-up]]
When you begin to off balance, you first always have to bring your knees to the chest.

Ways to off balance:
- Hooking or framing on the far thigh, bring them close, then away, while grabbing onto the collar. [[#^fb9732]]

Sweeping to the hooked leg side:
- If they step back to remove the frame, you can bring your knees to your chest, and off balance to the hooked leg side.

**If they step the far foot close enough for you to reach**, then you can grab it and pull it towards you to assist in sweeping. Here are some ways to force them to take that step as well:
- Cross your feet (**DLR** hook under the other foot), pinch the knees, and turn yourself in the direction.
- Deep DLR hook.
If they can post you can push on the hip and go into mount (Test this out)

Sweeping overhead:
- You can off balance them overhead, and take their [Back](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FBack). [Link](https://youtu.be/F7uZnNpPy8Y?si=_eWaPjGcvoTt24HK&t=13)
If you off balance them away from the hooked leg: ^fb9732
- [Wrestle-up](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Transitions%2FWrestle-up) then progress into a [Single Leg](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Takedowns%2FSingle%20Leg. [Link](https://youtu.be/F7uZnNpPy8Y?si=_eWaPjGcvoTt24HK&t=13).
- You can also [Triangle](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FTriangle%20Choke), since you can isolate a head and arm. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEGGBDJRTaw)
- Lastly you can take the Back either AOJ style or Crab Ride.
# Variations
- [[Deep DLR-X Guard]]: If the passer back steps. One drawback is it locks you inside sweeping.
- Reverse DLR:
## Grip Variations
- Pant grip (gi):
- Underhook:
- Bicep grip (gi):
### Pant Grip (Gi)
This variation only works in the gi. You grab the pants.
### Underhook
Rather than a foot or pant grip, you underhook their leg.

This helps with off balancing
### Bicep Grip
In this variation, you are framing the far foot on the far bicep.
