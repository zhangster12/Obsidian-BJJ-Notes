# Overview
The <u>Butterfly Guard</u> is one of the simplest, yet most effective open guard and can be used against opponents of any size as it utilizes the strongest part of our body-the legs, to pull, lift, and off-balance the opponent.

# Entry
If the passer is on their knees, then the guard player can simply insert 2 hooks in the passerâ€™s thighs.
# Passing
There are multiple ways to pass
Tripod up
Under hook a side
Flatten them out
Cross face
Stuff 1 leg
# Attacking
Most commonly, Butterfly Guard is used to sweep or off balance.

There are various configurations you can use with your arms to do so:
- Shoulder clamp
- Double under
- Head and arm
- Collar sleeve with a foot on the hip

You can enter Lapel Guard from the last 1.


To set up sweep:
- over back grup on gi.
- kick out their leg

If they stand up and plant on foot when sweeping, either push knee/foot away, plant foot on knee/foot and use it as leverage when sweeping, or if their leg is too close, go to ashi or x guard
# Retention
Force them onto their back.

If the opponent is able to force you to your back or body locks you:
- Use your legs to push away their legs to create enough space to bring your legs back in

Keep hips in line, this will prevent knees from being smashed

Sticky hooks

Knees to chest
