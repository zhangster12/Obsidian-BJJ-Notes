# Overview
The <u>Butterfly Guard</u> is one of the simplest, yet most effective open guard and can be used against opponents of any size as it utilizes the strongest part of our body-the legs, to pull, lift, and off-balance the opponent.

# Entry
If the passer is on their knees, then you can insert 2 hooks in their thighs.
# Passing
- Tripod Pass
There are multiple ways to pass
Tripod up
Under hook a side
Flatten them out
Cross face
Stuff 1 leg
# Attacking
- [Butterfly Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FButterfly%20Sweep): Your foot is already on the outside, which makes it easier to begin the sweep. Drive your head into their chin, pull them onto you, and turn their body.
- [Turtle](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FTurtle): If you pull down on their head and technical stand up, you force them 
- **Backwards sweep**: If they have their weight back, it will be difficult to complete the [Butterfly Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FButterfly%20Sweep); therefore you can sweep them backwards by technical standing up, as you push forwards.

Most commonly, Butterfly Guard is used to sweep or off balance.

There are various configurations you can use with your arms to do so:
- Shoulder clamp
- Double under
- Head and arm
- Collar sleeve with a foot on the hip

You can enter Lapel Guard from the last 1.


To set up sweep:
- over back grup on gi.
- kick out their leg

If they stand up and plant on foot when sweeping, either push knee/foot away, plant foot on knee/foot and use it as leverage when sweeping, or if their leg is too close, go to ashi or x guard
# Retention
Force them onto their back.

If the opponent is able to force you to your back or body locks you:
- Use your legs to push away their legs to create enough space to bring your legs back in

Keep hips in line, this will prevent knees from being smashed

Sticky hooks

Knees to chest
# Variations
- **2 hooks**: This is the most common configuration, where both feet are hooked onto the passerâ€™s thighs.
- 1 hook, 1 foot outside: In this configuration, one hook is hooked on their thigh, while the other is outside their knee. The advantage is that the outside foot is already in sweeping position.
