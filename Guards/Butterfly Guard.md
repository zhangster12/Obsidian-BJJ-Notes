# Overview
The <u>Butterfly Guard</u> is one of the simplest, yet most effective open guard and can be used against opponents of any size as it utilizes the strongest part of our body, the legs, to pull, lift, and off-balance the opponent.

# Entry
- If the passer is on their knees, then insert two hooks in their thighs.
# Passing
- Force the guard player onto their back.
## Passes
- [[Body Lock Pass]]:
- [[Smash Pass]]:
- [[Tripod Pass]]: If you have an underhook, tripod, flatten the guard player with a heavy cross face, and stuff a leg.
# Retention
- **Off balancing**: <u>Butterfly Guard</u> is used to off balance or sweep. Break the passer’s posture to load them onto you.
# Transitioning
## Grips
- [[Cross Collar Grip]]:
## Positions
- [[Turtle]]: If you pull down on their head and technical stand up, you force them to [Turtle](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FTurtle).
## Submissions
- [[Cross Choke]]:
## Sweeps
- [[Butterfly Sweep]]: Drive your head into their chin, pull them onto you, and turn their body.
## Transitions
- [[Arm Drag]]:
- [[Wrestle-up]]: If they have their weight back, it will be difficult to complete the [Butterfly Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FButterfly%20Sweep); therefore, sweep them backwards by technical standing up, as you push forwards.
# Retention
- **Forward shift**: When the passer flattens you out, forward shift by extending your hooks (not too far out) as you sit up, then brign your legs back in front.
- **Sticky hooks**:
- **Knees to chest**: 
- **Hips in line**: Be square to them. This prevents your knees from being smashed.
## Troubleshooting
- 
# Variations
- [[Butterfly-Half Guard]]: Insert one of your hooks between the passer’s legs.
## Hand Position
- Shoulder clamp
- Double underhooks
- Head and arm
- Collar/sleeve with a foot on the hip
## Foot Position
- **2 hooks**: This is the most common configuration, where both feet are hooked onto the passer’s thighs.
- **1 hook, 1 foot outside**: In this configuration, one hook is hooked on their thigh, while the other is outside their knee. The advantage is that the outside foot is already in sweeping position.
