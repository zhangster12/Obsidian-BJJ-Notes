# Overview
<u>Half Guard</u> is a guard in which you have 1 leg in and 1 leg out. It is an excellent passing and sweeping position.

# Entry
During reguarding, you can enter <u>Half Guard</u> as a pitstop during reguarding.

During passing, you can force <u>Half Guard</u> by placing 1 leg in between yours and dropping to your knees or when the opponent tries to underhook the leg when you’re [Knee Cutting](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passing%2FKnee%20Cut).
# Passing
To pass <u>Half Guard</u>, you have to get chest-to-chest to the opponent. This can be accomplished by getting past the ***top leg*** [[#^ca35da]] or the ***bottom knee***. 

Chest-to-chest is a very good position, because you can pin the opponent without passing. To pass:
- Maintain a heavy crossface.
- Tripod up and use a shoelace.
- Hook on the outside.

Getting past the top knee can be accomplished by: ^ca35da
- Shifting back to [HQ](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passing%2FKnee%20Cut), then to a [Knee Cut](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passing%2FKnee%20Cut).
- You can also Hip Switch into Reverse Half Guard then pull the leg out.

You can end up in Side Control or Mount. In chest-to-chest, you need to watch out for a [Lever Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FLever%20Sweep).
# Retention
Some of the keys to retaining <u>Half Guard</u> are:
- Maintaining frames
- Staying on the side (you don’t want to be flattened out). If you’re flattened out, then you won’t be able to maintain a knee shield.

Where to frame:
- Armpit
- Across the collar bone or neck
- Wrist

If they manage to grab your collar and, you can block their outside knee and off balance them to get them to post, or if they face plant by not letting go, you can come up for the sweep.
