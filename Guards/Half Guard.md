# Passing
- Get chest-to-chest by getting past the top knee.
- Get past the top knee by (1) shifting to [HQ](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passing%2FKnee%20Cut) then [Knee Cut](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passing%2FKnee%20Cut) or (2) hip switch into [Reverse Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FReverse%20Half%20Guard) then pull the leg out.
- Watch out for the [Lever Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FLever%20Sweep).
## Passes
- [[Leg Drag]]:
- [[Leg Weave]] (If they collapse their knees)
## Grips
- [[Brabo Grip]]: Use it to separate the guard player’s knee and elbow and underhook the far side. Flatten them into [Chest-to-Chest](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FChest-to-Chest%20Half%20Guard).
## Guards
- [[Chest-to-Chest Half Guard]]: 
- [[Reverse Half Guard]]:
# Retention
- **Frames**: Frame across the collar bone or neck, on the wrist, at the armpit.
- **Staying on your side**: If you’re flattened out, you can’t maintain a knee shield.
## Troubleshooting
- If the passer grabs your collar or neck, block their outside knee and off balance them to get them to post. If they face plant by not letting go, come up to sweep.
# Transitioning
## Guards
- [[Butterfly Guard]]: Hook the top leg in the thigh and pull your bottom leg out.
- [[Clamp Guard]]: Off-balance the passer with your Cross Collar Grip and high knee shield. Shoot your leg through their armpit and extract your leg.
- [[Closed Guard]]: Stuff their outside knee so you can extract and lock your legs around them.
## Submissions
- [[Kimura]]:
## Sweeps
- [[Lever Sweep]]: If their weight is loaded on top.
## Transitions
- [[Arm Drag]]: If the top player punches out, the elbow is exposed.
# Variations
- [[Butterfly-Half Guard]]: One foot is hooked outside the passer’s thigh.
- [[Chest-to-Chest Half Guard]]:
- [[Deep Half Guard]]:
- [[Dogfight]]:
- [[Reverse Half Guard]]: You’re facing the guard player’s legs.
- [[Z-guard]]:
