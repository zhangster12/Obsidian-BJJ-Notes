# Overview
<u>Half Guard</u> is a guard in which you have one leg in and one leg out. It is an excellent passing and sweeping position.

# Entry
- Mount: During reguarding, you can enter <u>Half Guard</u> as a pitstop during reguarding.

During passing, you can force <u>Half Guard</u> by placing 1 leg in between yours and dropping to your knees or when the opponent tries to underhook the leg when you’re [Knee Cutting](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passing%2FKnee%20Cut).
# Passing
- [[Body Lock Pass]]
- [[Leg Drag]]
- [[Leg Weave]] (If they collapse their knees)
## Grips
- [[Brabo Grip]]: Use it to separate the guard player’s knee and elbow and underhook the far side. Flatten them into [Chest-to-Chest](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FChest-to-Chest%20Half%20Guard).
## Guards
- [[Chest-to-Chest Half Guard]]: 
- [[Reverse Half Guard]]:

To pass <u>Half Guard</u>, you have to get chest-to-chest to the opponent. This can be accomplished by getting past the ***top leg*** [[#^ca35da]] or the ***bottom knee***. 

Getting past the top knee can be accomplished by: ^ca35da
- Shifting back to [HQ](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passing%2FKnee%20Cut), then to a [Knee Cut](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passing%2FKnee%20Cut).
- You can also Hip Switch into Reverse Half Guard then pull the leg out.

You can end up in Side Control or Mount. In chest-to-chest, you need to watch out for a [Lever Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FLever%20Sweep).
# Retention
- Maintaining frames
- Staying on the side (you don’t want to be flattened out). If you’re flattened out, then you won’t be able to maintain a knee shield.

Where to frame:
- Armpit
- Across the collar bone or neck
- Wrist

If they manage to grab your collar and, you can block their outside knee and off balance them to get them to post, or if they face plant by not letting go, you can come up for the sweep.
# Transitioning
## Guards
- [[Clamp Guard]]: Off-balance the passer with your Cross Collar Grip and high knee shield. Shoot your leg through their armpit and extract your leg.
- [[Closed Guard]]: Stuff their outside knee so you can extract and lock your legs around them.
## Submissions
- [[Kimura]]
## Sweeps
- [[Lever Sweep]]: Off-balance the passer outside your knee.

# Variations
- [Butterfly-Half](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FButterfly-Half%20Guard): One foot is hooked outside the passer’s thigh.
- [Chest-to-Chest](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FChest-to-Chest%20Half%20Guard):
- [Deep Half](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDeep%20Half%20Guard):
- [Reverse Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FReverse%20Half%20Guard): You’re facing the guard player’s legs.
