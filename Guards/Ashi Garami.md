# Overview
<u>Ashi Garami</u> (which is different from single-leg X) is a guard in which your legs are entangled around one of the opponent’s legs.

# Entry
One principle of entering **Ashi** is *off balancing:*
- From [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva), shoot your outside leg through their legs. 
- From Shin-on-Shin, simply roll to the opposite side of the leg to off balance them and lift their foot up. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQQTST4DySY)

Another principle is *turning a bad position into a good position*:
- Sometimes when escaping the [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) using the [Knee Elbow Escape](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Escapes%2FKnee%20Elbow%20Escape), the opponent place all their weight on one knee. When that happens, you can shrimp to the opposite side into **Ashi**.
- From the Back, once you’ve escaped, you can prevent them from coming into Mount and then enter Ashi.
# Passing
Typically once an opponent initiates **Ashi**, the best course of action is to drop to one knee.

If you wish to remain standing, make sure to *turn the outside knee in* and *pinch the knees*, similar to [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva). Planting your knee in back of their thigh will make it very difficult for them to establish hooks.
- After doing so, strip the outside leg and then the inside hook. Lock out the arms. Once you’ve pushed on the inside leg. You can step back if they push back and into [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard).
# Retention
The most important part of **Ashi** is controlling the ankle, because if the opponent tries to pass to mount, there’s still enough space to re-guard.
## Attacking
To sweep, try to grab the far sleeve/arm, so they aren’t able to base or grab both pants/ankles.

When you sweep you have to raise your hips explosively.
