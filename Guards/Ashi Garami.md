# Entry
Off-balancing:
- Butterfly Guard: Extend the passer overhead, so they’re on all 4 limbs.
- DLR: Shoot your outside leg through their legs. 
- Shin-on-Shin: Roll to the opposite side of the leg to off balance them and lift their foot up. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQQTST4DySY)

## Positions
Escaping from bad positions:
- Back: After escaping the Back, block the top player’s hip to prevent them from entering Mount, then enter Ashi when they do.
- Mount: When escaping the [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) using the [Knee Elbow Escape](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Escapes%2FKnee%20Elbow%20Escape), if the top player places their weight on one knee, shrimp to the opposite side to enter Ashi.
# Passing
Standing:

- Forward/back step: 
- Half Guard:
- Mount:

Control the heel using the inside arm, then use your outside arm to balance. As you press their heel to butt. they will push back. as they do push it outside your hip.



Once an opponent enters <u>Ashi</u>, the passer can either **drop to one knee** or **remain standing**. Either way, the first step is to **peel and control the outside foot**; controlling the foot will prevent the guard player from entering other guards, such as [X-guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FX-guard).

The next step is to **control the inside hook**. Once both feet are controlled, the passer can advance towards a dominant position
- If the guard player’s legs are not tight towards their chest, then the passer can simply push the inside leg back and sit into [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount).

If you wish to remain standing, make sure to *turn the outside knee in* and *pinch the knees*, similar to [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva). Planting your knee in back of their thigh will make it very difficult for them to establish hooks.
- After doing so, strip the outside leg and then the inside hook. Lock out the arms. Once you’ve pushed on the inside leg. You can step back if they push back and into [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard).
Push their head away as you sprawl back
# Retention
- **Lifting the hips**: Maximizes control.
- **Controlling the ankle**: If the passer tries to sit to [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount), there will still be enough space to re-guard.
- **Hooking the inside foot on the far hip**: This controls their hips better than if the foot was hooked on the near hip, like in single-leg X.
- **Keeping the passer’s ankle off the mat**: They won’t be able to crowd you and this turns you into a ball.
# Transitioning
- Tilt Sweep

Bridge and knee them in the butt to get their to place hands on mat, then wrselt up or x-gaurd

- Sweeping: 
- Raise your hips up exploively
To sweep, try to grab the far sleeve/arm, so they aren’t able to base or grab both pants/ankles.

When you sweep you have to raise your hips explosively.

- [Dummy Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FDummy%20Sweep): If you have both legs, you can pull the outside leg out.

Knee tap if they place knee on matt
