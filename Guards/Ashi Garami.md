# Entry
## Guards
- [Butterfly Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FButterfly%20Guard): Extend the passer overhead, so they’re on all 4 limbs.
- [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva): Off balance them, then shoot your outside leg through their legs. 
- [Shin-on-Shin](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FShin-on-Shin%20Guard): Roll to the opposite side of the leg to off balance them and lift their foot up. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQQTST4DySY)
## Positions
- [Back](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FBack): After escaping, block the top player’s hip to prevent them from entering [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount), then enter <u>Ashi</u> when they do.
- [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount): After escaping with the [Knee Elbow Escape](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Escapes%2FKnee%20Elbow%20Escape), if the top player places their weight on one knee, shrimp to the opposite side to enter <u>Ashi</u>.
# Passing
- **Pinch your knees**: When you’re standing, turning your knees in makes it harder for the guard player to establish hooks, similar to [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva). Specifically plant your knee behind their thigh.
- **Strip the outside and inside hooks**: Leaning your body away from the outside hook and extending your arm makes it easier to peel it. Push down on the inside hook to prevent them from controlling you.
- **Drop to your knees**: This makes it harder for them to off balance you.
- **Forward/back step**: After controlling the ankles, taking a forward/back step allows you to move around their legs.
## Guards
- [Half Guard]: Control the inside heel using your inside arm. As you press their heel to butt, they will push back. As they do, push it outside your hip. Push their head back as you sprawl back to free your ankle.
## Positions
- [[Mount]]: Strip the ankle and push the knee back as you sit down.
- [[Side Control]]: Take a forward/back step, then drop your weight down.
# Retention
- **Lifting the hips**: Maximizes control.
- **Controlling the ankle**: If the passer tries to sit to [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount), there will still be enough space to re-guard.
- **Hooking the inside foot on the far hip**: This controls their hips better than if the foot was hooked on the near hip, like in <u>Single-leg X</u>.
- **Keeping the ankle off the mat**: They won’t be able to crowd you and this turns you into a ball.
# Transitioning
## Guards
- [[X-guard]]: (1) If the passer strips your outside ankle, or (2) plant one foot on the mat, bridge, and knee the passer in the butt to get their to place hands on mat.
## Submissions
- [[Straight Ankle Lock]]
## Sweeps
- [[Dummy Sweep]]: If you have both legs, pull the outside leg out.
- [[Knee Tap Sweep]]: If the passer places their knee on the mat.
- [[Tilt Sweep]]: Raise and turn your hips explosively. This helps if you have both legs or the far arm controlled.
## Transitions
- [[Wrestle-up]]: Plant one foot on the mat, bridge, and knee the passer in the butt to get their to place hands on mat.
