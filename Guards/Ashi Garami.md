# Overview
<u>Ashi Garami</u> (which is different from single-leg X) is a guard in which your legs are entangled around 1 of the opponent’s legs.

# Entry
1 principle of entering **Ashi** is *off balancing:*
- From [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva), shoot your outside leg through their legs. 
- From Shin-on-Shin, simply roll to the opposite side of the leg to off balance them and lift their foot up. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQQTST4DySY)

Another principle is *turning a bad position into a good position*:
- Sometimes when escaping the [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) using the [Knee Elbow Escape](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Escapes%2FKnee%20Elbow%20Escape), the opponent place all their weight on 1 knee. When that happens, you can shrimp to the opposite side into **Ashi**.
- From the Back, once you’ve escaped, you can prevent them from coming into Mount and then enter Ashi.
# Passing
Once an opponent enters <u>Ashi</u>, the passer can either **drop to one knee** or **remain standing**. Either way, the first step is to **peel and control the outside foot**; controlling the foot will prevent the guard player from entering other guards, such as [X-guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FX-guard).

The next step is to **control the inside hook**. Once both feet are controlled, the passer can advance towards a dominant position
- If the guard player’s legs are not tight towards their chest, then the passer can simply push the inside leg back and sit into [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount).

If you wish to remain standing, make sure to *turn the outside knee in* and *pinch the knees*, similar to [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva). Planting your knee in back of their thigh will make it very difficult for them to establish hooks.
- After doing so, strip the outside leg and then the inside hook. Lock out the arms. Once you’ve pushed on the inside leg. You can step back if they push back and into [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard).
# Retention
- Lifting the hips will maximize control.
The most important part of <u>Ashi</u> is controlling the ankle, because if the opponent tries to pass to mount, there’s still enough space to re-guard.

Inside hook is on far hip.

If the guard player keeps the passer’s ankle off the mat, they won’t be able to crowd the guard player. Turn yourself into a ball.
## Attacking
To sweep, try to grab the far sleeve/arm, so they aren’t able to base or grab both pants/ankles.

When you sweep you have to raise your hips explosively.
