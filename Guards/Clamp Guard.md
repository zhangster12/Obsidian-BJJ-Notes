# Overview
<u>Clamp Guard</u> is similar to [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard), but with an overhook. Similar to [Ashi Garami](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FAshi%20Garami), <u>Clamp Guard</u> is an isolation of one arm.

# Entry
## Guards
- [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard): Break the passer’s posture and get their hand to the mat.
## Positions
- [Side Control](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FSide%20Control): If the top player is adamant about keeping an underhook, control that arm, then recover.
# Passing
- 
# Retention
- Be on one hip, not square to the passer.
- Point your top leg down for downward pressure.
- Flex your top foot at the far clavicle.
- Keep the bottom leg tight.
- Frame on the far bicep with the bottom arm underneath the bottom leg to prevent them from pushing the leg cut to [Knee Cut](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passing%2FKnee%20Cut).
## Troubleshooting
- 
# Transitioning
## Positions
- [[Reverse Triangle]]:
- [[Trap Triangle]]: If the passer postures up.
- [[Turtle]]: If they free their arm.
## Submissions
- [[Armbar]]: If the passer’s hand is in your armpit.
- [[Cross Choke]]: If you have a Cross Collar Grip with your overhook.
- [[Kimura]]: If the passer bends their arm back to defend a [Straight Arm Lock](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FStraight%20Arm%20Lock). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ojphoRQ5qo)
- [[Omoplata]]: If they bend their arm back to defend a [Straight Arm Lock](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FStraight%20Arm%20Lock), you can also use your legs.
- [[Punch Choke]]: 
- [[Straight Arm Lock]]: Scoop their arm over their shoulder.
- [[Triangle Choke]]: If they posture up.
- [[Wrist Lock]]: If the Straight Arm Lock doesn’t work and you’ve isolated an arm, attack the wrist.
# Variations
- **Knee in front of the face**: Place your bottom leg in front of the passer’s near side neck with your foot hooking at the armpit.
- **Overhook**:
- **Cross collar grip**: With your overhook, grab the opposite collar.
