# Overview
In [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard), you would typically shift your hips to the outside to create an angle, so this guard is a continuation of that principle, with the overhook.

Additionally, the other hand should be framing at the bicep with the elbow outside/underneath the to prevent them from [Knee Cutting](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Guard%20Passing%2FKnee%20Cut).
