# Overview
<u>Clamp Guard</u> is similar to [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard), but with an overhook. Similar to [Ashi Garami](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FAshi%20Garami), this guard is an isolation of one arm.

# Entry
Entering <u>Clamp</u> occurs from [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard) after you’ve broken the passer’s posture and gotten their hand to the mat.
# Retention
- Not being square to the passer and being on your side.
- Pointing the top leg down for downward pressure and keeping the foot flexed and at the far clavicle.
- Keeping the bottom leg tight to the passer with the bottom arm underneath it framing the bicep to prevent them from pushing the leg cut to [Knee Cut](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passing%2FKnee%20Cut).
- Securing a cross collar grip with the overhook hand (gi).
# Attacking
The arm placement will dictate how to attack:
- You can attack an Straight Arm Lock or traditional arm bar. with the arm at the arm pit.
	- After attempting an Armbar and you’ve isolated an arm, you can Wrist Lock them.
	- If after attempting the Armbar and the passer bends their arm back, you can attack an Omoplata.
- If the passer manages to free their free from your armpit, you can take the Back, because they’ve given up Turtle.
If its int he armpit, armbar or kimura. if not armpit, trinakle or maybe omoplata, you can still armbar

In the gi, there is a cross choke


# Variations
- **Knee in front of the face**: You can place your bottom leg in front of the passer’s near side neck with your foot hooking at the armpit.
