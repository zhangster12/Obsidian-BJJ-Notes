# Setup
You can set the Hip Bump Sweep in different ways, but they all begin with their posture back:

## Closed Guard
- Break their posture, so their hands are on the mat
- Plant the right foot on the mat
- Sit up and control the opposite forearm with your right-hand
- Post your left hand on the mat
- Bump the hip into them to end up in the mount
