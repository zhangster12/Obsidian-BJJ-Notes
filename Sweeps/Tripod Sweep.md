# Overview
The **Tripod Sweep** is basically a sweep where you typically control the opponent’s legs as you use kuzushi (off-balancing) to force them to the mat. There are several variations of the **Tripod Sweep** in BJJ, but the fundamental definition of gripping the opponent’s legs as you off-balance them remains the same.

# Defense
The most basic defense of a **Tripod Sweep** is to never step in with 2 feet at a time. They can then grab both of your feet to sweep you.
