# Overview
The <u>Lever Sweep</u> is a sweep from [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard) where you use your legs to control and leverage the passer's leg, using it as a lever to unbalance and sweep them over. You apply pressure on the passer's knee joint, creating a strong leverage point to initiate the sweep.
