# Overview
The <u>Lever Sweep</u> is a sweep from [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard) where you use your legs to control and leverage the passer's leg, using it as a lever to unbalance and sweep them over. You apply pressure on the passer's knee joint, creating a strong leverage point to initiate the sweep.

# Setup
The <u>Lever Sweep</u> is used in bottom [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard), in which the passer is chest-to-chest or threatening to control the head. You may not succeed, but it can off balance the passer for you to reestablish frames.
# Keys
- Plant your feet on the outside of the passer’s knee and back-heel.
- Pinch your knees.
- Block their underhooked arm elbow to elbow.
- Bridge and rotate yourself while pushing the opposite hip or pants.
# Transitioning
If you complete the sweep:
- [Chest-to-Chest Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FChest-to-Chest%20Half%20Guard): Sweep into [Chest-to-Chest Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FChest-to-Chest%20Half%20Guard).
- [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard): Sweep into regular [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard).
- [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount): Grab the outside pants/leg and step over as you sweep. [Link](https://youtu.be/81OLg2IPSl4?si=HE83Wi27V9AYrOf9&t=15)

If the passer posts their arm/leg:
- [Butterfly-Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FChest-to-Chest%20Half%20Guard): Hook the outside foot onto the thigh.
- [Butterfly Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FButterfly%20Sweep): Sweep to the other side after inserting the hook.
- [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard): There’s enough space on the opposite side of sweeping to extract the inside leg and wrap around the passer.
- [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard): Reestablish frames to recover.
# Defense
- Don’t load yourself onto the guard player, because it makes it easier for them to sweep you.
- If they do sweep you, try and free your arm and post, but they’ll reestablish frames.
# Variations
- [Chest-to-Chest](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FChest-to-Chest%20Half%20Guard): Shoot your knees all the way through the passer’s legs.
- [Regular](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard): Pinch your legs in front of their hip, because they are upright.
