# Overview
The <u>Lever Sweep</u> is a sweep from [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard) where you use your legs to control and leverage the passer's leg, using it as a lever to unbalance and sweep them over. You apply pressure on the passer's knee joint, creating a strong leverage point to initiate the sweep.

# Setup
The <u>Lever Sweep</u> is used in bottom [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard), in which the passer is chest-to-chest or threatening to control the head. You may not always succeed, but it can off balance the passer for you to reestablish frames.
# Keys
- Having both feet on the outside of the knee and back-heeling.
- Blocking the underhook arm elbow to elbow.
- Bridging and rotating while pushing the opposite hip or pants.
## Knee Position
If the passer is chest-to-chest, the inside knee should be all the way between the passer’s legs, whereas, if the passer is a little more upright, then the inside knee is out.
# Transitioning
You can use this sweep to get your frames in front, sweep into top position, or step over the bottom player’s leg into [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount). [Link](https://youtu.be/81OLg2IPSl4?si=HE83Wi27V9AYrOf9&t=15)
