This is often achieved by applying pressure on the passer's knee joint, creating a strong leverage point to initiate the sweep.

The <u>Lever Sweep</u> is used in bottom [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard), in which the passer is chest-to-chest or threatening to control the head.
