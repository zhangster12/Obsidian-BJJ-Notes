# Setup
The <u>Muscle Sweep</u> can be setup when the top player stands up in [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard) with both feet at arms length.
# Keys
When the top player stands, the bottom player underhooks the foot at the elbow while their other hand is using a cross sleeve grip.

Even when the top player stands, the bottom player should keep their hips up.

The bottom player can also gable grip their hands at the ankle.

When the sweep is complete, the bottom player should keep control of the leg.

The point of no return is when the top player manages to collapse the bottom playerâ€™s hips. At that point, the bottom player should switch to another guard.
# Defense
The top player should push down on the knee or move 1 foot back.

Sometimes before the bottom player can come up into Mount, the top player can sit up quickly.
# Variations
## Reverse Muscle Sweep
If the top player steps over the arm, the bottom player can switch to sweeping at the other leg. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0OX0VZN9Qw)
