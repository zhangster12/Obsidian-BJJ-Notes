# Overview
The **Scissor Sweep** is a technique characterized by the scissoring motion of your legs to unbalance and sweep an opponent. It is an excellent technique to demonstrate how BJJ uses leverage to move large opponents.

# Setup
You can set up the sweep from an Arm Drag attempt:

- When the opponent resists the arm drag from closed guard:
	- While holding onto the sleeve, hook the right foot to the right armpit and the left foot to the left hip
	- Push off the hip and raise the foot
	- Once theyâ€™re falling, bring the foot to the knee and kick back

- 2-on-1 grip and pull the arm towards you
