# Setup
## Guards
- Butterfly Guard:
# Keys
- Keep the knee that’s hooked on the thigh pointed towards the ceiling and retracted towards your shoulder.
- Drive off the toes with the foot by your butt.
- Tuck the trapped arm deeply and grab at the elbow.
- Bring the passer’s head below their hips.
- Bring the passer’s shoulder to the head. This twists their upper body, making their spine out of alignment.
- Come onto your knees if you’re having trouble completing the sweep.
## Troubleshooting
- **Passer posts leg**: (1) Push their knee/foot away or (2) plant your foot on their knee/foot and chop it, or (3) reverse shrimp.
- **On knees**: (1) Kick their knee out, (2) Scissor Sweep with the Butterfly hook, or (3) if their weight is back, drive them forward.
# Transitioning
- **Leg is too close**: Underhook and transition to [X-guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FX-guard) or [Ashi](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FAshi%20Garami).
- 
## Guards

- [[X-guard]]:
## Positions
- [[Mount]]:
# Defense
- Post on the leg of the side you are being swept.
## Passes
- [[Tripod Pass]]:
# Variations
## Grips
- **2-on-1**: Instead of gripping outside the triceps, grip at the interior crux of the elbow. To reinforce this, grab your own wrist with the outside arm.
- **Double underhooks**:
- **Over/under**:
- **Sleeve/belt or back (gi)**:
- **Shoulder crunch**: While you can sweep towards the side of the trapped arm, you can also sweep to the opposite side, again, by bringing the opposite side shoulder to the mat.
- **Head & arm**:
