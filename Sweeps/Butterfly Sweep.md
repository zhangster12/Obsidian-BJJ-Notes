# Overview

![Butterfly Sweep](https://www.bjjee.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/final_615f28a20827c4005ba3ec32_180848-1.png)
# Entry/Setup

# Keys
- Keep the knee that’s hooked on the thigh pointed towards the ceiling and retracted towards your shoulder.
- Stay on the toes on the bottom hook. Bring the foot to the butt.
- Tuck the trapped arm deeply and grab at the elbow.
- Bring the passer’s head below their hips.
# Transitioning
Ideally, you’d sweep into top position([Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) or [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard)), but if the passer posts onto one leg, there are a few options:
- If their leg is very close, you can underhook it and enter [X-guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FX-guard) or [Ashi](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FAshi%20Garami).
- If their leg is within leg’s reach, then you can plant your bottom foot on their shin or knee and drive off of that to complete the sweep like a [Scissor Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FScissor%20Sweep). If they continue to hop away, reverse shrimp to follow them.
- [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard): since the passer’s elbow and knees are separated.
# Defense
Post on the leg of the side you are being swept.
