# Setup
- Butterfly Guard:

# Keys
- Keep the knee that’s hooked on the thigh pointed towards the ceiling and retracted towards your shoulder.
- Drive off the toes with the foot by your butt.
- Tuck the trapped arm deeply and grab at the elbow.
- Bring the passer’s head below their hips.
- Bring the passer’s shoulder to the head. This twists their upper body, making their spine out of alignment.
- Come onto your knees if you’re having trouble completing the sweep.

To set up sweep:
- over back grup on gi.
- kick out their leg

If they stand up and plant on foot when sweeping, either push knee/foot away, plant foot on knee/foot and use it as leverage when sweeping, or if their leg is too close, go to ashi or x guard
## Completing The Sweep
# Transitioning
## Guards
- [[Ashi Garami]]: If the passer’s leg is posted.
- [[Closed Guard]]: If the passer’s elbows and knees are separated.
- [[Half Guard]]
- [[X-guard]]
## Positions
- [[Mount]]
Ideally, you’d sweep into top position ([Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) or [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard)), but if the passer posts onto one leg, there are a few options:
- **Leg is too close**: Underhook and enter [X-guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FX-guard) or [Ashi](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FAshi%20Garami).
- **Leg is reachable**: Plant your bottom foot on their shin/knee and drive off of that to complete the sweep. This is similar to a chopping motion like a [Scissor Sweep](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Sweeps%2FScissor%20Sweep). If they continue to hop away, reverse shrimp to follow them.

Other options: If they’re on knees
- Kick knee out (Wide knees)
- sciors sweep with butterfly hook (narrow knees)

Weight back, drive them forward
# Defense
- Post on the leg of the side you are being swept.
# Variations
## Grips
- 2 on 1: Instead of gripping outside the triceps, grip at the interior crux of the elbow. To reinforce this, grab your own wrist with the outside arm.
- Double underhooks:
- Over/under:
- Sleeve/belt (gi):
- **Shoulder crunch**: While you can sweep towards the side of the trapped arm, you can also sweep to the opposite side, again, by bringing the opposite side shoulder to the mat.
