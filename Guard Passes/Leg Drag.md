# Overview
The <u>Leg Drag</u> is a passing position where the passer controls the bottom player's hip by dragging their leg towards 1 side, hence the <u>Leg Drag</u>.

# Entry
Standing vs. supine:
- The passer can use a [Cross Pant Grip](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Grips%2FCross%20Pant%20Grip) to drag 1 leg to the other side.
- The passer can turn the bottom player’s shin away (no-gi).
- The bottom player will pummel their other leg. In response, the passer can pin it with your knee then dive for the other leg (AOJ). [Link](https://youtu.be/72Sn9CBYX90?si=vYlOiRfJb-qJk-U1&t=49)
- After a [Circle Pass](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Circle%20Pass) and the passer ends up in the [J-point](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FJ-point), if the bottom player frames on the shoulder and bicep, the passer can walk the knee to the opposite side into a <u>Leg Drag</u>.

In [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard), the bottom player can overcommit when pummeling; the passer can then easily set up a <u>Leg Drag</u>.
# Keys
- Pinning the bottom leg and close off the elbow-knee space.
- Pinching into the bottom player’s hip with the outside knee.
- Gripping onto the lapel (inside) and horse collar (outside) (gi).
# Transitioning
If the bottom player is on their side or tries to [Turtle](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FTurtle%20Guard), this is ideal for taking the [Back](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FBack).

If the guard player is framing at the shoulder, the passer can move the frame to one side and block with the chest/shoulder.
