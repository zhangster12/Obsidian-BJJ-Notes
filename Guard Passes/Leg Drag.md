# Entry
## Grips
- [Cross Pant Grip](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Grips%2FCross%20Pant%20Grip): Use this grip to drag one leg to the other side.
- The passer can turn the bottom player’s shin away (no-gi).
- The bottom player will pummel their other leg. In response, the passer can pin it with your knee then dive for the other leg (AOJ). [Link](https://youtu.be/72Sn9CBYX90?si=vYlOiRfJb-qJk-U1&t=49)
## Guards
- [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard): If the guard player overcommits when re-pummeling, pass their leg outside.
## Passes
- [Circle Pass](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Circle%20Pass): While you’re in the [J-point](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FJ-point), if the guard player frames on your shoulder and bicep, walk the knee to the opposite side.
# Keys
- Pin the bottom leg and close off the elbow-knee space.
- Pinch into the guard player’s hip with the outside knee.
- Grip onto the lapel (inside) and horse collar (outside) (gi).
- If the guard player is framing at the shoulder, the passer can move the frame to one side and block with the chest/shoulder.
