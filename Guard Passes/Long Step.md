# Overview
The <u>Long Step</u> is a pass that requires the top player take a <u>Long Step</u> away from the legs of the guard player so as to escape.

# Entry
Entering a <u>Long Step</u> can happen from a [Knee Cut](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FKnee%20Cut) or from HQ.

With a [Knee Cut](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FKnee%20Cut), the guard player usually has a RDLR hook. Ideally, the guard player shouldn’t be framing at the shoulder, otherwise the <u>Long Step</u> may not work, so the passer can use movement and sped to distract the guard player.
# Keys
One common misconception of the <u>Long Step</u> is that it’s a back step; they are 2 different concepts, so the passer shouldn’t be facing towards the ceiling after the <u>Long Step</u>.

To execute a <u>Long Step</u>:
- Grab a collar and pant grip (gi) or head and ankle (no-gi). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FIBw6DJgAw&t=7s)
- With those grips, shift back to semi disengage.
- Drop the knee and elbow to the mat.
- Drop the hip to the mat, while stepping the leg out.
- Stay on the toes then tripod.

If the guard player is able to maintain connection to the legs after the <u>Long Step</u>, then the passer should chain to a different pass.
# Defense
- Frame at the passer’s shoulder.
# Variations
In the gi, the passer grabs the collar and pants, while in no-gi, they grab the head and ankle.
