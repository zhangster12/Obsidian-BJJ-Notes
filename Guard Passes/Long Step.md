# Entry
Entering a Long Step can happen from a Knee Cut or from HQ.
## Knee Cut
- If they have a RDLR hook:
	- Knee and elbow goes to the mat
	- Tripod up
# Keys
- This isn't the same as a back step.
- Shift back to semi disengagement
If the guard player is able to maintain connection to your legs after the Long Step, then the passer should chain to a different pass.
