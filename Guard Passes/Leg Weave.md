# Overview
The <u>Leg Weave</u> is a pressure pass that depends on properly pinning the guard player’s hips and legs using the passer’s body weight.

# Entry
When the guard player has a knee shield, such as in the [Knee Cut](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FKnee%20Cut) or [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard), the <u>Leg Weave</u> can be used to pin the leg. 
# Keys
- In the gi, grabbing a collar and pant grip.

# Defense
The guard player should frame across the neck of the passer and post onto their elbow to create space.
# Variations
In no-gi, the passer would punch their fist to the mat and pressing down and grabbing the neck.
