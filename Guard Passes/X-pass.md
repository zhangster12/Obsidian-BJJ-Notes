# Overview
The <u>X-pass</u> is named after the X configuration of your arms and legs during the execution of the technique. The objective is to bypass the guard player’s legs by creating an angle and using your limbs to manipulate their legs out of the way. This is similar to the [Toreando](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passing%2FToreando), as it is similar in setup, but the execution is a little different.
