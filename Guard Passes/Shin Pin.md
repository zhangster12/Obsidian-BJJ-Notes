# Overview
The <u>Shin Pin</u> is when the passer presses their shin into the guard player’s shin, effectively pinning it.
# Entry
The passer can set up a <u>Shin Pin</u> while lateral passing such as the [Circle Pass](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FCircle%20Pass).
# Keys
The key to this pass is leaning forward and pressing the shin against the guard player’s shin.
# Transitioning
The passer pressing their shin into the guard player’s shin will force them to kick out, and the passer can pass into [KOB](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FKnee%20On%20Belly) or [Side Control](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FSide%20Control).
