# Overview
The <u>Side Body Lock</u> is a variation of the [Body Lock Pass](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FBody%20Lock%20Pass) where the guard player is on their side and you’re outside of their knees.
# Setup
## Passes
- [Tripod Pass](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FTripod%20Pass): When the guard player is in Butterfly Guard, push their knees to one side as you lock your hands underneath them.
# Keys
- Like a [Smash Pass](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FSmash%20Pass), press your weight onto the guard player’s knees.
