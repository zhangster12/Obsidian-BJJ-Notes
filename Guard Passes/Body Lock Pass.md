# Overview
The <u>Body Lock Pass</u> is a pressure pass in which you control the guard player's torso by wrapping their arms around the waist as they pass the guard.

# Setup
You can setup the <u>Body Lock</u> from [Butterfly Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FButterfly%20Guard) or anytime the guard player’s knees and elbows are separated.
# Keys
# Transitioning
## Guards
- [[Half Guard]]
# Defense
- [[Butterfly Guard]]: Frame on the neck (misaligns the passer’s head) and push their legs away as you sit up (prevents you from being flattened).
# Variations
- **Front**: This variation is the most basic, where you’re square with the guard player.
- **Side**: You can tripod when the guard player is in Butterfly Guard, then push their knees to one side as you lock your hands underneath them.
- **High**: This variation is essentially double underhooks and connecting your hands behind the guard player’s neck.
