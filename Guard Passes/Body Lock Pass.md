- [High Body Lock](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FHigh%20Body%20Lock%20Pass): Double underhooks and with your hands connected behind their neck.
- [Side Body Lock](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FSide%20Body%20Lock%20Pass): Instead of being in between their legs, you’re outside their knees.
