# Overview
The <u>Body Lock Pass</u> is a pressure pass in which you control the guard player's torso by wrapping their arms around the waist as they pass the guard.

# Setup
You can setup the <u>Body Lock</u> from [Butterfly Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FButterfly%20Guard) or anytime the guard player’s knees and elbows are separated.
# Keys
# Transitioning
# Defense
- [[Butterfly Guard]]: 
- Sit up from your back, because the passer wants to flatten you out.
- Push their legs away with your legs as you set up.
- Frame on the neck; this pushes the passer’s head out of alignment so you can get your legs in front.
# Variations
- **Front**: This variation is the most basic, where you’re square with the guard player.
- **Side**: You can tripod when the guard player is in Butterfly Guard, then push their knees to one side as you lock your hands underneath them.
- **High**: This variation is essentially double underhooks and connecting your hands behind the guard player’s neck.
