# Setup

# Keys
- Be on your toes.
- Turn your knees in.
- Lock out your arms and bringing the guard player’s ankles to their thighs. You may also keep your elbows tight ([Nick and Danny Seminar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Seminars%2FNick%20and%20Danny's%20Seminar%20(4-30%20-%205-3-2024))).

## Troubleshooting
- 
# Transitioning
## Guards
- [[Half Guard]]: Drop into [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard) to reserve energy.
## Passes
- [[Leg Drag]]: If there are frames, walk to the other side.
- [[Knee Cut]]: If the guard player tracks you with their feet, pin their leg.
## Positions
- [[J-point]]: Instead of a [Leg Drag](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FLeg%20Drag), camp the position to fatigue the guard player.
- [[North-South]]: Walk around, then drop your chest down.
- [[Side Control]]: If there are no frames, drop your weight.
- [[Turtle]]: If they feel danger, they may roll into [Turtle](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FTurtle.).
# Defense
## Guards
- [[Supine Guard]]: Frame at the shoulders and hip, then use your legs to square yourself back up.
## Positions
- [[Turtle]]: If you’re in danger of being passed, roll into [Turtle](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FTurtle.).
