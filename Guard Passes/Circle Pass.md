# Overview
# Setup
In the standing vs. supine case, the passer begins by controlling the ankles, then laterally moves to control the knee and hip in the [J-point](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FJ-point).
# Keys
The passer should be on the toes unless they’re dropping down into [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard).
# Transitioning
- If there are no frames, the passer can simply drop their weight into [Side Control](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FSide%20Control).
- If the there are frames, the passer can walk to the other side for a [Leg Drag](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FLeg%20Drag).
- If the guard player begins to track the passer with their feet, they’ve opened themselves to a [Knee Cut](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FKnee%20Cut).

# Defense
First, the guard player should be framing at the shoulders and hip; these frames are temporary and should be replaced by legs.
