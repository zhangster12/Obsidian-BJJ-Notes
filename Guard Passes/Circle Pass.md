# Overview
The <u>Circle Pass</u> is a pass in which the passer circles around the guard player’s legs. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnieVr0cVnY)
# Setup
In the standing vs. supine case, the passer begins by controlling the ankles, then laterally moves to control the knee and hip in the [J-point](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FJ-point).
# Keys
At the beginning, when the passer is controlling the ankles:
- Being on the toes.
- Turning the knees in.
- Locking out the arms and bringing the guard player’s ankles to their thighs.
	- At the [Nick and Danny Seminar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Seminars%2FNick%20and%20Danny's%20Seminar%20(4-30%20-%205-3-2024)), they taught T. rex arms, so keeping the elbows tight to the body and using the forearms.

When moving laterally, the passer should be on the toes unless they’re dropping down into [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard), and they shouldn’t be within arms length of the guard player.
# Transitioning
- If there are no frames, the passer can simply drop their weight into [Side Control](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FSide%20Control).
- If the there are frames, the passer can walk to the other side for a [Leg Drag](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FLeg%20Drag). The passer can also camp the position to make the guard player more fatigued ([J-point](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FSide%20Control)).
- If the guard player begins to track the passer with their feet, they’ve opened themselves to a [Knee Cut](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passes%2FKnee%20Cut).
- The top player can also drop into [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard) to reserve energy.
# Defense
First, the guard player should be framing at the shoulders and hip; these frames are temporary and should be replaced by legs.
