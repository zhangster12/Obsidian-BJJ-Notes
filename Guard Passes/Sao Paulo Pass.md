# Overview
The <u>São Paulo Pass</u>, also known as the <u>Tozi Pass</u> or hammerlock, is a pass that traps your opponent's hand so you can apply pressure to their shoulder and limit attacks while passing the guard.

# Setup
- [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard): [Link](https://youtu.be/bs0IejiQ76Q?si=Pz8df0ArRqzGehA0&t=122)
# Keys
- Maintain pressure into the guard player’s head and chest the whole time.
- Keep the chest and shoulders pinned while you cut an angle on their legs.
- Be aware of Omoplata and Triangle.
# Variations
- **Arm passed**: Pin an arm. This has the most control.
- **Lapel passed (gi)**: Remove the lapel and use it to wrap around the arm as you pass it behind the back. The lapel is more assessable, it slides to the elbow and the guard player can still use their arm to frame. You more easily pin the arm to the mat and upgrade to the arm passed variation.
- **Underhook**:
