# Overview
The <u>São Paulo Pass</u>, also known as the <u>Tozi Pass</u> or hammerlock, is a pass that traps your opponent's hand so you can apply pressure to their shoulder and limit attacks while passing the guard.

# Setup
In [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard), there are 3 ways to set up the <u>São Paulo Pass</u>: [Link](https://youtu.be/bs0IejiQ76Q?si=Pz8df0ArRqzGehA0&t=122)
- Underhook
- Pinning 1 arm
- Wrapping a lapel around the guard player’s arm
# Keys
- Maintaining pressure into the head and chest the whole time.
- Keeping the chest and shoulders pinned while cutting an angle on the guard player’s legs.
- Being aware of Omoplata and Triangle.
# Variations
- **Arm passed**: Pin an arm. This has the most control.
- **Lapel passed (gi)**: Remove the lapel and use it to wrap around the arm as you pass it behind the back. The lapel is more assessable, it slides to the elbow and the guard player can still use their arm to frame. You more easily pin the arm to the mat and upgrade.
- **Underhook**:
# Attacking
There are 2 submissions following this pass:
- [Kimura](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FKimura): Pass into [Side Control](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FSide%20Control) with the arm controlled. Scoop your free hand under their shoulder, sit them up, and apply the [Kimura](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FKimura).

- [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FArmbar): If the [Kimura](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FKimura) fails, control the other arm and step over to [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FArmbar).

Use can push them away byt the neck.
