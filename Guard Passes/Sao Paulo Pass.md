- Wrapping a lapel around the guard player’s arm

- Be aware of Omoplata and Triangle.
# Variations
## Arm Passed
For this variation, you pin 1 arm.

# Attacking
There are 2 submissions following this pass: [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FArmbar) and [Kimura](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FKimura).
- The [Kimura](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FKimura) can be done after you are in [Side Control](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FSide%20Control) with the arm controlled. From there, you need to bring them facing you on their side, so you can begin to apply the [Kimura](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FKimura).

- If the [Kimura](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FKimura) doesn’t work, then you can control the other arm and step over for the [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FArmbar). [Link](https://youtu.be/NCp6xctn1lQ?si=I3VB44ahIH86txMF&t=220)
