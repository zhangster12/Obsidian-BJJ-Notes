# Overview
The <u>Knee Cut</u>, or <u>Knee Slice</u>, is a pass where you uses your near leg’s knee to pin and slice through the guard player’s leg while the other leg bases on the mat.

# Entry
- From [HQ](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FHeadquarters), you can <u>Knee Cut</u> if the center knee falls towards the passer’s outside knee.
- In [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva), you can  <u>Knee Cut</u> after striping hooks and frames. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqCi1GXmOg)
# Keys
The <u>Knee Cut</u> has multiple moving parts and small details.
## Posture
The passer should maintain a low posture to pressure the guard player as much as possible.

Lucas Lepri is upright, because he has beaten the knee shield.
## Hand Position
- Lucas Lepri grabs onto the same side lapel and pulls it towards him (gi).
- The passer can place their hand on the rib (no-gi). The passer can then bring their shoulder to their hand, then underhook to block the knee shield.
- Underhook applies to both gi and no-gi. While the passer can grab an underhook, before the <u>Knee Cut</u>, this doesn’t always happen.
## Frames
When the guard player frames or reinforces their knee, the passer can:
- Pin the same side hand to the mat with the palms up (no-gi).
- Grab an overhook at the elbow to control the shoulder (gi). [Link](https://youtu.be/3IqCi1GXmOg?si=XUMxI-s71szT7O3r&t=216)
## Knee Shield
- Lucas Lepri pulls on the guard player’s elbow and pushes on their chest (while maintaining lapel grip), repositions his knee in the middle of their legs, and finally wedges his elbow between himself and their knee. [Link](https://youtu.be/3IqCi1GXmOg?si=oqSGg4PyTXnBmQzT&t=304)
- Punching out the knee. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Hy0XYZMV0vo)
## Finishing the <u>Knee Cut</u>
- Lucas Lepri points the knee towards the floor and along the rib and pivots the outside leg (with the knee turned in) around the inside knee. This goes around the knee shield and applies more pressure to the guard player. [Link](https://youtu.be/3IqCi1GXmOg?si=MCDGWSUvhwUWIHMJ&t=262)
- The passer can point the knee at the stomach so when the guard player redirects it when during the <u>Knee Cut</u>, it goes to the floor.
- Once the pass is complete, if the bottom player tries to escape, the top player can follow them by walking the hips back.
## RDLR Hook
- Popping the RDLR hook out then shin slice.
- Donkey kicking.
# Attacking
When the guard player attempts to sit up for an underhook, the passer can counter with a [Loop Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FLoop%20Choke). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNd3w5m1xs) The passer can also back step in a Reverse Half Guard (as long as they’re controlling the far side underhook, and freeing the knee line by getting the knee to the mat).

# Defense
## Frames
- Reinforcing the knee with the arm (with a RDLR hook).
- Using a knee shield.

The frames will prevent the passer from advancing and force them to switch to a different pass; the frames can also drive the passer away, after which the guard player can sit up an underhook and [Wrestle-up](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Transitions%2FWrestle-up).
## Hooks
- Using the outside leg to butterfly hook the passer’s heel and push them into [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kikzEqPZPQ&t=69s)
- Grabbing an outside pant grip (gi) or foot (no-gi).
- Using a RDLR hook.
