# Overview
The <u>Knee Cut</u>, or knee slice, is a pass in which the passer uses their near leg’s knee to pin and slice through the opponent’s leg while the other leg bases on the mat.

# Entry
- From [HQ](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FHeadquarters), the passer can <u>Knee Cut</u> if the center knee falls towards the passer’s outside knee.
- In [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva), the passer can enter a <u>Knee Cut</u> after striping hooks and frames. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqCi1GXmOg)
# Keys
The <u>Knee Cut</u>, seemingly simple, has multiple moving parts and small details.
## Posture
The passer should maintain a low posture to pressure the bottom player as much as possible. 
## Hand Position
- Lucas Lepri grabs onto the same side lapel and pulls it towards him (gi).
- The passer can place their hand on the rib (no-gi). The passer can then bring their shoulder to their hand, then underhook to block the knee shield.
- Underhook applies to both gi and no-gi. While the passer can grab an underhook, before the <u>Knee Cut</u>, this doesn’t always happen.
## Frames
When the bottom player frames or reinforces their knee, the passer can:
- Pin the same side hand to the mat with the palms up (no-gi).
- Grab an overhook at the elbow to control the shoulder (gi). [Link](https://youtu.be/3IqCi1GXmOg?si=XUMxI-s71szT7O3r&t=216)
## Knee Shield
- Lucas Lepri pulls on the bottom player’s elbow and pushes on their chest (while maintaining lapel grip), repositions his knee in the middle of their legs, and finally wedges his elbow between himself and their knee. [Link](https://youtu.be/3IqCi1GXmOg?si=oqSGg4PyTXnBmQzT&t=304)
- Punch-out that knee. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Hy0XYZMV0vo)
## Finishing the <u>Knee Cut</u>
- Lucas Lepri points the knee towards the floor and along the rib and pivots the outside leg (with the knee turned in) around the inside knee. This goes around the knee shield. [Link](https://youtu.be/3IqCi1GXmOg?si=MCDGWSUvhwUWIHMJ&t=262)
- You can also point the knee at the stomach so when the opponent tries to redirect it when you slide, it goes to the floor.
- Once the pass is complete, if the bottom player tries to escape, the top player can follow them by walking the hips back.
## RDLR Hook
If there’s a RDLR hook, the passer can:
- Pop it out then shin slice.
- Donkey kick.
# Attacking
When the bottom player attempts to sit up for an underhook, the passer can counter with a [Loop Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FLoop%20Choke). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZNd3w5m1xs)
# Defense
The bottom player needs to frame on the passer’s opposite shoulder and arm and have a knee shield, which will prevent them from advancing and force them to switch to a different pass.
- The bottom player can use the outside leg to butterfly hook the passer’s heel and push them into [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard).

The bottom player can also drive the passer away, after which the bottom player can sit up an underhook and [Wrestle-up](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Transitions%2FWrestle-up).

In the gi, the bottom player can grab an outside pant grip.
