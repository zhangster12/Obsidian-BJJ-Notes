### Passes
- [[Smash Pass]]: Place your hand behind the guard player’s back to prevent them from getting their shoulders to the mat.
## Systems
- [[Straightjacket System]]: The closed wedge is the most superior form of a wedge, because it is a closed loop. For example, keeping the foot up as high as possible on a body triangle makes it very difficult for your opponent to escape. Keeping a tight seat around their neck and shoulders is another form oaf a closed wedge.
