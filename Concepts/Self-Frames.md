# Overview
<u>Self-Frames</u> are structures created with your limbs against your body to maintain space, control distance, and prevent an opponent from collapsing your posture or passing your guard. By using your skeletal structure, rather than muscular strength, to support weight and absorb pressure, it makes it your defense more efficient and less tiring.
