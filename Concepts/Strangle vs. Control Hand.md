# Overview
The idea of a Strangle vs. Control Hand while on the [[Back]] is the idea that one hand is attacking the neck and the other is controlling your opponent. You can have two strangle hands or two control hands, but you sacrifice your control and attacks, respectively; thus, having one of each is the best compromise.
# Core Mechanics
- **Strangle hand**: The overhook side is attacking your opponent’s neck.
- **Control hand**: The underhook side keeps your chest glued to their back, so if their try to turn, you can follow them.
