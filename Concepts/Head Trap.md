# Overview
The <u>Head Trap</u> is the idea that your strangle hand and your head should be on opposite sides of your opponent’s head while you’re on their [[Back]]. You need this to be able to strangle your opponent from the [[Back]]. This is the number one problem to address when on the [[Back]], because it prevents you from attacking and allows them to escape.
# Core Mechanics
- **Ear-to-ear**: Place your head ear-to-ear next your opponent’s.
- **Closed loop**: This removes the hole for them to move through if they fall on the underhook side. Place your strangle hand over their shoulder and your chin over it
# Applications
## Nodes
### Positions
- [[Back]]: By keeping your head below your opponent’s head, you prevent escapes and allows you to attack. They’re actively trying to disrupt this to escape and defend submissions. If you see their head starting to drift away, you need to re-trap it. You can also switch arms.
