# No-gi
At Paul Schreiner’s seminar, we briefly covered Tripod Passing [Butterfly Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FButterfly%20Guard) 3 ways:
- Pummeling left. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqWfsjNd7Pg)
- Pummeling right if there is a sticky hook.
- Hopping up onto the head and around.

In the gi, we can use a pant grip to better control it, but for both we have to get to an underhook.
# Gi
In the gi, we covered [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) retention methods, the [Cross Collar Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FCross%20Collar%20Choke), and his version of an [Ezekiel Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FEzekiel%20Choke).

For the [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount):
- You want to get to high [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount).
- Plant the feet on the hips.
- Grab the back of their triceps.
- Lean back and slouch.

For the [Ezekiel Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FEzekiel%20Choke):
- Use the [Ezekiel](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FEzekiel%20Choke) to separate their arms from their side.
- If they’re tight, start low and slowly wedge your hips in between their arms.
- Use the arm on the shoulder.

For the [Cross Collar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FCross%20Collar%20Choke):
- Grab a deep collar grip.
# Concepts
Some of the key concepts we covered were:
- When retaining [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount), you think of it as riding a bull.
- Use the [Ezekiel Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FEzekiel%20Choke) to counter a [Kipping Escape](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Escapes%2FKipping%20Escape).
