# No-gi
## Setup
From standing 50/50 (underhook/overhook), bring the overhook side foot perpendicular to them, while bringing your other foot to trip. Look back as far as you can, so they follow that direction.

As they recover, lock the Front Headlock (one hand on chin, one hand on triceps).
## Option 1
As they try to move around, use your hand on their chin to block their  knee, so they end up in bottom Side Control.
## Option 2
1. Step to the side with the triceps.
2. Press your forehead into their ribs or turn their neck in the opposite direction.
3. Place their leg between your knees.
4. If they stand up, Wrestle-up, or grab their hip and take their Back.
