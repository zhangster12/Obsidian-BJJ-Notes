# No-gi
We went over the Arm Saddle position, that we used to Arm Bar, enter K Guard, and either Take the Back or enter a leg lock entanglement.

We worked on an Arm Saddle drill in which the opponent was pressing down the bottom leg or reaching for the neck. Some of the keys for the drill were:
- Pulling them away from you instead of towards you.
- Framing with the top leg.
- Clamping down on the shoulder
- Using the hip as a checkpoint frame.
- Back heeling and controlling the wrist.

We then worked on going into K guard and Taking the Back from there through Crab Ride.
# Gi
We went their variation of [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva), with some details:
- Keeping the knees pointing up towards the ceiling, so they when the opponent tries to remove them, it’s difficult.
- The foot that is framing is on the hip to prevent them from stepping over.
- A light collar grip so you can adjust your body position depending on if they posture up or crouch. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/02jQ2CylttM)

We worked on off balancing 3 ways:
- We swept right, if they’re trying to remove the hook.
- We swept left, if they’re removing the frame.
- Lastly, we swept overhead if they try to post on your body.

Lastly, we worked a few sweeps and Back Takes:
- If we swept left, we keep the bottom foot as a frame on the stomach, plant the top leg on the mat, switch hands, and the Technical stand-up.
- If we swept right or overhead, we can [Take the Back](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Transitions%2FTaking%20the%20Back).
# Concepts
We went over a few key concepts:
- Every guard should have a sweep, submission, or taking the back.
- The guard that you choose to play should have the widest margin of error, so if you mess up somewhere, it won’t cost you.
- Frames are not meant to track the opponent down.
- Use the skeletal structure as a frame.
- T. rex arms (leading with the shoulder and keeping the arms short) when approaching supine guard.
- If you’re using a lot of upper body effort, then you will stop using as much lower body, and vice versa.
