# Overview
The [[Back]] is the most dominant position in BJJ, because you have multiple high percentage submissions, while your opponent has very little. In addition, strangles are superior to joint locks, because while you can endure damage to a joint, you cannot endure a strangle, as you’ll become unconscious. However, because of the points system, athletes have no intention to submit from the [[Back]], only maintain.

Thus, John Danaher has devised the <u>Straightjacket System</u>, which takes advantage of the sequential nature of Back escapes.
# Entry
- 
# Core Concepts
- [[Strangle vs. Control Hand]]:
- [[Spinal Alignment on the Back]]:
	- [[Diagonal Control]]:
	- [[Head Trap]]:
- [[2-on-1]]: Pin the arm on the side of the strangle hand, but you need to fall to the side of your underhook or trap the arm in Turtle.
- [[High Percentage Submissions]]:
## Troubleshooting

# Primary Attack Chain
- 
# Counters (& Counters To Them)
- **Beat the bottom hook**: When they step over your bottom hook, (1) extend your leg out. This creates distance for them to slide over your knee. Bring your bottom foot close and bridge to the other side. (2) Step on their hip with your top foot. This makes their hips heavy, so you can elevate and grab your bottom hook with your top arm and lock a body triangle.
- **Beat the bottom knee**: When they slide over the bottom knee, maintain the [[Head Trap]], by bringing your head to the mat first, tripoding, lifting your arms to expose their side, sliding your knee up, as to roll to the other side.
- **Repetitive side switching**: When your opponent behinds the process of escaping, you have to switch to the other side to preserve [[Spinal Alignment on the Back]]. Eventually, they will escape, unless you create a closed loop, such as a body triangle or crossing your feet underneath one hip.
- [[Straight Ankle Lock]]: When you cross your feet over to set up a body triangle, your opponent can from to Straight Ankle Lock you. When they do this, remove both of your hand sand post on their head. This prevents them from bridging.
- **Bring the head below**: When your opponent gets their head below your head, switch arms. Your top hand becomes a control hand, and use it to control their bottom arm, as you extract your bottom hand and pull them over.
# Typical Sequences
- 
# Limitations
- **Limited use of limbs**: The <u>Straightjacket System</u> only uses your arms to attack your opponent’s neck. This allows them to focus all their defense on their neck.

## To Organize

attakc back 2
Grisp:
Straight grips (left to left, etc.): grab at the knuckle line

Cross grips (left to right): Treat their hand as knot for your thumb

Hierachy of hand gihting positionsL
On the control side: your hand always needs to be on top.
Line of chest is a good cue to strip grips if it s blellow

2 top cross grips > 2 top straight grips > 2 bottom straight grips

cocentration principle
use all your weapons to attack one area (neck) and other attacks to diffuse attention to other places
