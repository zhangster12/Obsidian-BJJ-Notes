# Overview
The **S-mount** is characterized by the “S” formation that you form using your legs as you sit on your opponent’s diaphragm.

# Entry
Typically entering S-mount occurs from [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) when you’ve separated their elbow from their hip.


## [[Mount]]
- Bait by grabbing a collar
- Once they defend, scoot up until the groin meets the armpit
- Move the arm to one side
- Scoop the other arm and control both arms
- Pinch the head with the foot and knee
# Keys
The keys to the S-mount are:
- The groin is tight at the armpit.
- The left knee is tucked beside the head.
- The right knee is tucked at the other armpit with, the feet at the head
- The foot and knee should be pinching their head
- The foot shouldn’t be over/under the head.
- If you can make them connect then that’s better.

The opponent should also be on their back and not their side, whereas in Technical Mount, the opponent is on their side.
