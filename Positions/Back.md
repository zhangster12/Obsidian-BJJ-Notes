# Overview
The Back is one of the most dominant positions, because while your opponent has very few attacks, you can attack them while controlling them.

# Entry
There are multiple ways to take the **Back**:
- In [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva), once the opponent is off balanced, you can take the hooked leg and turn it down to force them to their knees and turn them away from you. From there you can control the hips and gradually climb the back.
- In [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard), taking the Back can happen from an Arm Drag.
- In Technical Mount, you can take the back from a chair sit, by .
- In Turtle Guard,
# Retention
## Upper Body
### Seatbelt
When initially taking the back, this is good, but you can switch to better options. Ideally, you should be glued to your opponent’s back. Having a good seatbelt is important, because if they escape the legs, you can crunch them, slide the knee up their hip, and retake the back

Keys to having a good seatbelt:
- Pinching your elbows
- Placing your forearm on their beck
- Placing your head next to their head
### Gift Wrap
This can be used to control the arm as well as the back.
### Cross Collar Grip (Gi)
This is advantageous because this can lead to collar chokes and is more powerful than the regular seatbelt in the gi. If they pull down on your sleeve, you won’t be able to finish the choke, so you can switch to RNC.
## Lower Body

### Body Triangle
The body triangle has the greatest degree of control, but only if your legs are long enough to wrap around their body. You have to be careful of a Straight Ankle Lock.
### Hooks
Hooks are the weakest way to control the back, but if they’re in turtle, it might be useful to kick their legs back to flatten them out. This is the only form of control that will score points in a match.
### Feet on Hips
This is similar to the body triangle, but the legs aren’t locked. This is good for people whose waists are wider than your legs.
### Single Hook
This is good if you can’t get the other hook in. One leg is in, and the other leg is out. You can cross your feet behind their leg, or you can extend them out to get the other hook by pushing on their thigh with your shin and reinforcing with the other foot.

# Attacking
The opponent will likely be hand fighting you.

The majority of these attacks from the **Back** are strangles, which are superior to joint breaks, because sometimes the opponent will endure the damage, whereas a strangle will cause them to pass out.

Sometimes the opponent will have good **Back** defense. In this case, you can transition to the Armbar. [Here](https://youtu.be/xN0HUe8e2z0?si=lA9RZI6RCukJeAyK&t=1048) is an instance of Gordon Ryan doing this against Patrick Gaudio. You can extend your forearms to the 
# Escape
The first thing you need to do to escape the **Back** is to fight the hands, because they are going to be trying to choke you.

To escape the **Back**, you must do the following:
- Get the shoulders to the mat.
- Get your head below their head.
- Get past the hips.
