# Overview
The <u>Back</u> is the most dominant position, because while your opponent has very few attacks, you can attack them while controlling them.

# Entry
## Guards
- [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva): When the passer is off balanced, take your hooked leg and turn it down to force them to their knees and turn them away. Control the hips and gradually climb the <u>Back</u>.
## Positions
- [Technical Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FTechnical%20Mount): Chair sit.
- [Turtle](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FTurtle): (1) Slide your knee into the knee-elbow space or (2) break the bottom player down to the side.
## Transitions

# Retention
- **Cross body control**: Prevent your opponent from rotating their upper body.
- **Leg control**: Prevent them from escaping your hips.
- **Head position**: Place your head extremely close to their head and underneath their head to prevent them from escaping.
- **Chest-to back connection**: Glue yourself to their back.
### Upper Body
- **Seatbelt**: Place your choking hand under your other arm. Pinch your elbows, glue your forearm to their chest. Switch to other forms of control if you can. If they escape the legs, crunch your opponent, slide the knee up their hip, and retake the back
- **Gift wrap**: Use to control the arm as well.
- **Half Nelson**: Use to prevent them from rotating their upper body. Use on the side facing up.
- **Cross collar grip (gi)**: This can lead to collar chokes and is more powerful than the seatbelt in the gi. (1) If they pull down your sleeve, you won’t be able to finish the choke, so switch to RNC. (2) If they control your arm with 2-on-1 grip, bring their gi to your hand and climb their lapel like an inchworm.
### Lower Body
- **Body triangle**: This has the greatest degree of control. Wrap your legs around your opponent’s body in a triangle. Be careful of the Straight Ankle Lock.
- **Feet on hips**: This is similar to the body triangle, but your legs aren’t locked. This is good for people whose waists are wider than your legs.
- **Single hook**: If you can’t get your other hook in, (1) cross your feet behind their leg or (2) push down their thigh with your shin (reinforced by your foot) to get your other hook in. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUECcQ8JJeA)
- **Hooks**: This is the weakest way to control the back, but the only form that scores points in a match.
## Troubleshooting
- 
# Transitioning
- **Hand fight**: Put your opponent’s hands in a position where they can’t defend and threaten submissions.
- **Submission options**: Strangles are superior to joint breaks, because they’re willing to let those break, whereas strangles will be them lose consciousness.
## Positions
- [[Mount]]: If your opponent escapes.
- [[Spider Web]]: If they have good defense. [Link](https://youtu.be/xN0HUe8e2z0?si=lA9RZI6RCukJeAyK&t=1048)
## Submissions
- [[Bow & Arrow Choke]]:
- [[Sliding Collar Choke]]:
- [[Single Wing]]:
# Escape
- **Hand fighting**: Otherwise they’ll choke you.
- **Position**: Get your shoulders to the mat, head below your opponent’s head, and past their hips.
## Submissions
- [[Straight Ankle Lock]]: If your opponent has a body triangle or mistakenly crossed their feet.
