# Overview
The <u>Back</u> is 1 of the most dominant positions, because while the opponent has very few attacks, the player on the <u>Back</u> can attack them while controlling them.

# Entry
Taking the <u>Back</u>:
- In [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva), once the opponent is off balanced, the guard player can take the hooked leg and turn it down to force the passer to their knees and turn them away. The guard player can control the hips and gradually climb the <u>Back</u>.
- In [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard), taking the <u>Back</u> can happen from an Arm Drag.
- In [Technical Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FTechnical%20Mount), the top player can chair sit to the <u>Back</u>.
- In Turtle Guard, the top player can slide the knee into the knee-elbow space OR breaking the bottom player down to the side to take the back.

In the gi, using far side collar and lapel armpit grip is similar to a power half Nelson.
# Retention
Maintaining the <u>Back</u> requires cross body control.
## Upper Body
### Seatbelt
When initially taking the back, this is good, but you can switch to better options. Ideally, you should be glued to your opponent’s back. Having a good seatbelt is important, because if they escape the legs, you can crunch them, slide the knee up their hip, and retake the back

Keys to having a good seatbelt:
- Pinching the elbows.
- Placing the forearm on their beck.
- Placing the head next to their head.
### Gift Wrap
This can be used to control the arm as well as the back.
### Half Nelson
This is used to prevent the player being controlled from rotating their upper body. This should only be down on the side that’s facing up.
### Cross Collar Grip (Gi)
This is advantageous because this can lead to collar chokes and is more powerful than the regular seatbelt in the gi. If they pull down on your sleeve, you won’t be able to finish the choke, so you can switch to RNC.

If the opponent manages to use a baseball bat grip on the arm, bringing the gi to the hand instead of the hand to the gi will be much easier. Although the opponent has 2-on-1 grip, the one on the back can climb, like an inchworm, up the lapel.
## Lower Body
### Body Triangle
The body triangle has the greatest degree of control, but only if your legs are long enough to wrap around their body. You have to be careful of a Straight Ankle Lock.
### Hooks
Hooks are the weakest way to control the back, but if they’re in turtle, it might be useful to kick their legs back to flatten them out. This is the only form of control that will score points in a match.
### Feet on Hips
This is similar to the body triangle, but the legs aren’t locked. This is good for people whose waists are wider than your legs.
### Single Hook
This is good if you can’t get the other hook in. 1 leg is in, and the other leg is out. You can cross your feet behind their leg, or you can extend them out to get the other hook by pushing on their thigh with your shin and reinforcing with the other foot.

# Attacking
The opponent will likely be hand fighting you.

The majority of these attacks from the **Back** are strangles, which are superior to joint breaks, because sometimes the opponent will endure the damage, whereas a strangle will cause them to pass out.

Sometimes the opponent will have good **Back** defense. In this case, you can transition to the Armbar. [Here](https://youtu.be/xN0HUe8e2z0?si=lA9RZI6RCukJeAyK&t=1048) is an instance of Gordon Ryan doing this against Patrick Gaudio. You can extend your forearms to the 
# Escape
The first thing you need to do to escape the **Back** is to fight the hands, because they are going to be trying to choke you.

To escape the **Back**, you must do the following:
- Get the shoulders to the mat.
- Get your head below their head.
- Get past the hips.
