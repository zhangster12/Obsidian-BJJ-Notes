## Positions
- Mount: (1) Push one of the bottom player’s arm down. As they try to rescue it with their top arm, grab it with your bottom arm and bring your knee behind their head.
- [Side Control](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FSide%20Control): (1) Use a horse collar grip on the back of the bottom player’s neck to shuck their arm away and force them onto their side.
