# Overview
The <u>Mount</u> is one of the most dominant positions, hence earning 4 points when achieving in competition. One downside of <u>Mount</u> is that the opponent can still use their hips to bridge, so it’s important to monitor that.

# Entry
There are multiple ways to advance to **Mount** from Side Control:
- Walk your knees down, while maintaining cross face. Bring your knee over their waist, while keeping the other 1 on the toes. Walk their arm up. Bring your leg to the mat. Shelf the legs with your leg or slide into high mount.
- Shin slice across the hip.
- Press 
# Keys
Even in **Mount**, you need to be dynamic, so if you feel they’re beginning to escape, you need to transition.

For example:
- You can windshield your legs to [KOB](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FKnee%20On%20Belly).
# Attacking
You have to separate their elbows from their body to advance in position. This can be accomplished by an [Ezekiel Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FEzekiel%20Choke).
- If they're keeping their arms tight, use a cross grip and grip at the elbow and push the arm down.
- In gi, grab the collar.
# Escape
In the early stages, you have to use your elbows to block them from advancing.
# Variations
-  [S-mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FS-mount): Used to set up arm bars.

## Grapevine
The **Grapevine**, a technique where the legs wrap around the opponent’s legs from the mount position, is a formidable tool to pin and control the opponent. The grapevine adds a layer of lower body entanglement, enhancing stability while limiting the opponent’s mobility.
