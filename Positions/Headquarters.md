# Entry
## Guards
- [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva): Strip the guard player’s hooks, stuff their leg, and squat down on it.
- [Supine Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FSupine%20Guard): Step between their legs.
# Passing
- **Knee position**: The guard player’s knee position dictates the direction you pass.
- **Hand post**: When you pass to a side, post near or on the hip opposite of the direction you want to go, then post on far away on the far you’re passing towards. If you want to pass left, post near the right hip, then the left.

# Keys

## Troubleshooting
- **[DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva) hook**: If the guard player grabs your ankle/pants, reach inside their hook and strip their grip.
# Defense
- **Counter grips**: Use double collar grip or outside pant grip to prevent the passer from advancing or push them away.
- **Frames**: Use a [Shallow Lasso](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FShallow%20Lasso%20Guard) frame on the shoulder.
