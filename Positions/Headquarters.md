# Overview
<u>HQ</u> is a position in which you have 1 leg out and the other leg in and is a very good passing hub.

# Entry
This usually happens when you can get 1 leg between their legs and 1 leg outside theirs. 

This also happen when breaking out of a guard. For example: 
- In [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva), after you’ve stripped their hooks and stuffed their framing leg, you can squat down into **HQ**.

This can also happen in Open Guard where you step between their legs.
# Passing
You mainly pass left, right, and above. The direction you pass is dictated by the direction of their knee:
- If their knee is pointed in the direction of their outside knee, you can perform a [Knee Cut](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passing%2FKnee%20Cut).
- If their knee is pointed in the opposite direction, you can perform a [Smash Pass](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guard%20Passing%2FSmash%20Pass) or another pass in that direction.

When you pass to 1 side, post near the hip opposite of the direction you want to go, or on them, then post on far away on the far you’re passing towards:
- If you want to pass to the *left*, post near the *right* hip, then the *left*.
# Keys
The keys to **HQ** are:
- Pinching their leg or pinning their outside leg.
- Sitting back on their foot.
- Keeping the elbows and knees tight.
- In the gi, pulling up on their collar.

You can also be standing, as long as you keep your knees pinched
Bring your outside knee turned in at their thigh in this case. This is similar to passing Ashi and [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva), as they will be unable to establish any hooks.

Sometimes they will grab your ankle/pants to establish a [DLR](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FDe%20La%20Riva) hook. You have to address this first by reaching inside the hook and stripping their ankle/pant grip.
# Defense
The guard player has to defend by getting their feet back in front and getting the pinned leg out:
- The outside leg can be used to frame on the shoulder with a sleeve grip. The guard player can then use a same side collar grip to push the passer away and recovery their pinned leg. With the legs freed, the guard player can re-guard into [Lasso Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FLasso%20Guard) or [Shallow Lasso Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FShallow%20Lasso%20Guard).

The guard player can use counter grips (double collar grip, outside DLR pant grip) to prevent the passer from advancing.
