# Entry

# Passing
- [[Knee Cut]]: If the guard player tracks with their bottom foot.
- [[Leg Drag]]: If they're framing.
## Positions
- [[North-South]]
- [[Knee On Belly]]
- [[Side Control]]: (1) If the guard player doesn’t frame, drop into [Side Control](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FSide%20Control), or (2) if they collapse their top knee, press it to the mat and walk to the other side.
# Keys
- Step past the hip line.
- Control the knee while keeping the legs out of range of the hands.
- Heavy pressure on the ribs or hip.
# Escape
- If you can’t pummel your outside leg and frame at the shoulder, you can bring your knees in by pummeling underneath the passer’s armpit.
