# Entry
Typically, entering **Top Lock** occurs from [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard).

Ways to set up the Top Lock:
- Grab the opposite collar and sleeve and pull them towards you.
- If they grab onto your collar to control you, you can counter grip them by grabbing the opposite side collar and shelving their elbow, which will cause their elbow to bend once you pull them towards you.

To complete the **Top Lock**, push off their far hip as well as kicking them over to align yourself perpendicular to them. Using a windshield wiping motion, cover the far shoulder with your knee to pack it back. Once the shoulder is back, place your legs over their back and climb until the **Top Lock** is secure.

Alternatively, you can throw your legs over their shoulder very quickly.
# Retention
In the beginning, grabbing the highest possible grip on their collar will have the greatest amount of control. The leg that’s in line with the spine is on the bottom, otherwise there will be too much space between their back and your legs, and they will be able to posture up. The toes should be pointed toe to engage the hamstrings. Additionally, you can grab onto their leg to help reinforce the control.
# Attacking
There are multiple *arm* locks in the **Top Lock**:
- The [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FArmbar) is the most typical submission you will find, as you can simply bring the far arm to the hip bone. Alternatively, you can go to a traditional [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FArmbar) with the legs pressing down on their head. Lastly, by covering the hand of the far arm using your own elbow, the opponent will [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FArmbar) themselves by driving their shoulder in.
- The reverse [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FArmbar) is a variation that can be setup by bringing the wrist of their far arm between your shoulder and neck. The keys to a good inverted [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FArmbar): *pointing their thumbs down* and *gable gripping at the elbow*.

There are also multiple *shoulder* locks:
- If the opponent defends the [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FArmbar) in **Top Lock** by bending and retracting their arm, you can apply the [Americana](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FAmericana) by hyper externally rotating their arm. The opponent can defend this by extending their arm, which in turn will make them susceptible to the [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FArmbar).
- The [Kimura](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FKimura) can be applied to the near side arm by hyper internally rotating their arm. To make this tight, bring their arm as close along your own leg.

Lastly, if the opponent pulls their far arm out, you can swing yourself around to the other side and lock a [Triangle](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FTriangle%20Choke) or stay on the same side for [Reverse Triangle](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FReverse%20Triangle).
