# Overview
The <u>Turtle</u> is a defensive position in that’s characterized by exposing the back and curling up to a defensive stance with the neck and limbs kept close. Rolling to <u>Turtle</u> does not give up points.

# Attacking
There are 2 types of <u>Turtle</u>: wide and inside, which is characterized by the width of the base and the size of the knee-elbow space.
- In a wide <u>Turtle</u>, the top player can simply insert their knee inside.
- In an inside <u>Turtle</u>, the top player can roll the bottom player onto their side. This <u>Turtle</u> is much more common.

The top player should control the hips no mater what. Even of the bottom player rolls, the top player will remain on top.

Control the hips first, then climb to the rest of the body, then get hooks.

In the gi, the top player can grab the collar and the pants while keeping one knee at the side (on the mat) and there other behind the hips (off the floor).

If the bottom player attempts to get their back to the mat, the top player can use their knee as a wedge, do a chair sit motion, and take the Back.

3 ways
- power half
- hook onto far side foot and torque hip
	- Collar and armpit grip
- armpit grip and triceps grip (push triceps and pull armpit)

With the 1st hook inserted, there are options to break down the player in <u>Turtle</u> (assuming they’re in a narrow <u>Turtle</u>):
- Using an **armpit and horse collar grip** (gi). This is similar to a power half nelson.
- Using an **armpit and triceps grip** (gi). Simultaneously pushing the triceps away and pulling the armpit will force them to turn to their side.
- Using a **power half nelson**. Lowering their head while elevating their triceps will rotate their body onto their side.
- **Hooking onto the far foot**. When they try to move and with the foot hooked, kicking away and torquing their hip will rotate their body.

Any of these can be used in combination to each other.
