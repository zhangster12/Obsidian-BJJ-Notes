# Overview
<u>Side Control</u> is a pinning position when you’re perpendicular to your opponent and are not entangled in their legs. Typically, but not always you’re chest-to-chest with your opponent. Points are not scored for <u>Side Control</u>, rather scored for passing the guard.

# Entry
<u>Side Control</u> is a hub after you’ve passed the guard. This can be from open guard, half guard, closed guard, etc.
# Keys
The most basic <u>Side Control</u> consists of an under and overhook while having a good crossface, so your shoulder will be driving into their face. 1 knee should be under their near side shoulder and the other at their hip.

As with any other position, <u>Side Control</u> is **NOT** a static position because your opponent will be countering and trying to escape. You have to be dynamic when pinning your opponent. By switching from position to position, you can adapt to the energy he’s giving you and also create many opportunities to outmaneuver and set him up as he tries to recover his guard. Each variation allows you to adjust the point of pressure for your weight on your opponent while moving around their various attempts to escape, so you should become familiar with them all.
# Attacking
You can take the back by blocking the near side hip. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZfpXrlMueg&list=PLEt17gB8NjJfyEwTlMr7ct8IAo225ei_f&index=16)

You can attack the far side arm with a [Kimura](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FKimura), then straight arm lock, then Americana.

Additionally, you can attack the near side arm by placing your leg over it.

Attack the far arm by controlling it, then stepping around for Armbar.

## Additional Details



# Escape
To escape **Side Control**, you need to:
- Elbow frame at the hip.
- Get the shoulder to the mat.
- Frame on the biceps when they hip switch.
- Bring your knees/legs back in front of you.

You can escape into Half Guard, Closed Guard, and Butterfly Guard or if they leave they arm in, you can use the underhook to establish a [Clamp Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClamp%20Guard).

Sometimes the opponent has passed the guard but has not established a crossface:
- Control/frame on their biceps.
- Protect the head and neck before they can establish that.
- Frame at the triceps (if the top player exposes the back of their triceps), lock out the arm, then shrimp out, and reengage the guard.
- Kip up by using the legs, rather than simply sit up.
# Variations
In side control there are variations on pinning your opponent.

Stay near the hips
