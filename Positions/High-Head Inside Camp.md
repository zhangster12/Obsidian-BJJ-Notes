# Keys
- **Head position**: Head above your hips and over the guard player’s far shoulder.
- **Hand position**: Your hand can either push at their armpit or hug their hip.
- **Hip extension**: Extending your hips will drive more pressure into them.
- **Foot position**: Being on your toes will lessen the pressure, so don’t be on your toes.
