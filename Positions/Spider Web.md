# Overview
The <u>Spider Web</u> is a pinning position where you’ve isolated one of the bottom player’s arms. It’s typically used to set up an [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FArmbar) and sometimes a [Triangle Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FTriangle%20Choke).
