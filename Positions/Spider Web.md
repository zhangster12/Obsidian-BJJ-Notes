# Overview
The Spider Web is a pinning position in which the top player has isolated one of the bottom player’s arms. It’s typically used to set up an [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FArmbar) and sometimes a [Triangle Choke](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FTriangle%20Choke).
