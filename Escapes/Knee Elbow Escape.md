# Setup
The <u>Knee Elbow Escape</u> can be setup when the top player is in regular [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Positions%2FMount). If the top player has advanced to high [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Positions%2FMount), then this escape is ineffective.
# Keys
- Bumping the top player forward.
- Keeping the elbows tight and not opening the elbow-knee space (prevents the top player from advancing into high [Mount](), [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Submissions%2FArmbar), or [Mounted Triangle](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Submissions%2FMounted%20Triangle)).
- Being on the side.
- Pushing the top playerâ€™s knee out and collecting their leg.
- Framing their opposite biceps.

From there, the bottom player can re-guard into [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard) or [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard).
# Transitioning
Sometimes the top player will place all their weight onto 1 leg. In this case, the opposite leg is left, so the bottom player shrimp out into [Ashi](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Guards%2FAshi%20Garami). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSxb-WJ1QE)
# Counter
When the bottom player has shifted to their side, the top player can move with them and transition into [Technical Mount](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Positions%2FTechnical%20Mount). [Link](https://youtu.be/3sSLmjwOLmE?si=Laou-2LGzl-49mTP&t=84)
