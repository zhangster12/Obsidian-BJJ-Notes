# Overview
The <u>Knee Elbow Escape</u> is an escape from [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) that involves creating a frame and wedge under the top player's base. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T2SXB-4Fd8)

# Setup
This is most effective when the top player is in regular [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount). If theyâ€™ve advanced to [High Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FHigh%20Mount), then this escape is ineffective.
# Keys
- Bumping the top player forward.
- Keeping the elbows tight, which prevents them from advancing into [High Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FHigh%20Mount), [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FArmbar), or [Mounted Triangle](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FMounted%20Triangle).
- Being on the side.
- Pushing their knee out and collecting their leg.
- Framing their opposite biceps.

You can then re-guard into [Half Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FHalf%20Guard) or [Closed Guard](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FClosed%20Guard).
# Transitioning
Sometimes the top player will place all their weight onto one leg. In this case, the opposite leg is left, so you can shrimp out into [Ashi](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FAshi%20Garami). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSxb-WJ1QE)
# Counter
When the bottom player has shifted to their side, you can move with them and transition into [Technical Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FTechnical%20Mount). [Link](https://youtu.be/3sSLmjwOLmE?si=Laou-2LGzl-49mTP&t=84)
