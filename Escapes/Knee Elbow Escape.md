# Setup
- [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount): If the top player has advanced to [High Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FHigh%20Mount), then this escape is ineffective.
# Keys
- Bump the top player forward.
- Keep the elbows tight, which prevents them from advancing into [High Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FHigh%20Mount), [Armbar](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FArmbar), or [Mounted Triangle](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Submissions%2FMounted%20Triangle).
- Be on your side.
- Push their knee out and collect their leg.
- Frame their opposite biceps.
# Transitioning
- [[Ashi Garami]]: Sometimes the top player will place all their weight onto one leg; the opposite leg is light, so you can shrimp out into [Ashi](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FAshi%20Garami). [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBSxb-WJ1QE)
- [[Butterfly Guard]]
- [[Closed Guard]]: After re-guarding.
- [[Half Guard]]: After re-guarding.
# Counter
## Positions
- [[Technical Mount]]: When the bottom player has shifted to their side, you can move with them. [Link](https://youtu.be/3sSLmjwOLmE?si=Laou-2LGzl-49mTP&t=84)
