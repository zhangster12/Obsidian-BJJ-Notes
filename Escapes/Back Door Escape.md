# Overview
The <u>Back Door Escape</u> is a [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) escape, where instead of getting the legs back in front, you slide out from underneath. You slip out from the top player’s control through the space behind their back or under their arm, hence the term *backdoor*. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Psv5a2iiQbA)
