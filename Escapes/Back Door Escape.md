# Overview
The <u>Back Door Escape</u> is a [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) escape, where instead of getting the legs back in front, the bottom player slides out from underneath. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Psv5a2iiQbA)
# Setup
The back door escape is used when the top player has progressed to [High Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FHigh%20Mount), where it’s hard for the bottom player to bridge and use their hips.
