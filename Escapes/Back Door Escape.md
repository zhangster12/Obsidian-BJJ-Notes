# Overview
The <u>Back Door Escape</u> is a [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) escape, where instead of getting the legs back in front, you slide out from underneath. You slip out from the top player’s control through the space behind their back or under their arm, hence the term *backdoor*. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Psv5a2iiQbA)
# Setup
You use this escape when the top player has progressed to [High Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FHigh%20Mount), where it’s hard for you to bridge and use your hips.
# Keys
- Backwards rolling and planting your feet in the top player’s armpits.
# Transitioning
You can enter [Ashi](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Guards%2FAshi%20Garami) or if there’s a lot of space, a [Scramble](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Transitions%2FScramble).
