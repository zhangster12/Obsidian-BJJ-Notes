# Overview
The <u>Back Door Escape</u> is a [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) escape, where instead of getting the legs back in front, the bottom player slides out from underneath. The bottom player’s goal is to slip out from the top player’s control through the space behind their back or under their arm, hence the term “backdoor.” [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Psv5a2iiQbA)
# Setup
The <u>Back Door Escape</u> can be used when the top player has progressed to [High Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FHigh%20Mount), where it’s hard for the bottom player to bridge and use their hips.
