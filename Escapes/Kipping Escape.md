# Overview
The <u>Kipping Escape</u> is an escape that displaces the top player from top pins, such as [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) and [Side Control](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FSide%20Control).

# Setup
- [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount): This escape is good to use when the top player is crossing their feet beneath you.
# Keys
- Bridge to create space.
- Take the top player overhead with your arms rather than straight up.
- As you lower your hips, keep your arms on their hips as frames.
- Finally, use a jackknife motion to create momentum to bring your legs back in front. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9QZ2cad6k8)

- [[Butterfly Guard]]
