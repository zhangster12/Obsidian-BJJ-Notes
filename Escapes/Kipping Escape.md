# Overview
The <u>Kipping Escape</u> is an escape that displaces the opponent from top pins, such as [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) and [Side Control](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Positions%2FSide%20Control).

# Setup
If the top player is crossing their feet in [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Positions%2FMount), this escape is a good option to use.
# Keys
The bottom player first bridges to create space, then as they lower their hips, keeps their arms on the hips as frames. Finally, they use a jackknife motion create momentum to bring their legs back in front. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9QZ2cad6k8)

When creating space, the bottom player takes the top player overhead rather than straight up.
# Transitioning
If the top player posts on 1 leg, the bottom player can enter [Ashi](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Guards%2FAshi%20Garami).
# Counter
An [Ezekiel Choke](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Submissions%2FEzekiel%20Choke) will anchor the top to the bottom player in [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=BJJ%20Notes&file=Positions%2FMount), when they attempt this escape.
