# Overview
The <u>Bridge & Roll</u>, or <u>Trap & Roll</u>, is a [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) escape that involves trapping the top player’s arm, bridging and rolling to that side.
# Setup
## Positions
- [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount): If the top player has progressed to [High Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FHigh%20Mount), then this escape won’t be as effective.
# Keys
- Bump the top player forward so they’re on their hands.
- Trap an arm.
