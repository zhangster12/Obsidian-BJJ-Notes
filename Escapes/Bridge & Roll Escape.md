# Overview
The <u>Bridge & Roll</u> is a [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) escape that involves trapping the top player’s arm, bridging and rolling to that side.
# Setup
The <u>Bridge & Roll</u> can be used when the top player is still in [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount); if they’ve progressed to [High Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FHigh%20Mount), then it won’t be as effective.
