# Overview
The <u>Bridge & Roll</u>, or <u>Trap & Roll</u>, is a [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) escape that involves trapping the top player’s arm, bridging and rolling to that side.
# Setup
The <u>Bridge & Roll</u> can be used when the opponent is still in regular [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount); if they’ve progressed to [High Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FHigh%20Mount), then this escape won’t be as effective.
# Keys
- Bump the top player forward so they’re on their hands.
- Trapp an arm.
- Bridg and roll towards the trapped arm.
# Counter
You can free your arm and post, use your head as a post, or grapevine their legs to anchor yourself to the bottom player.
