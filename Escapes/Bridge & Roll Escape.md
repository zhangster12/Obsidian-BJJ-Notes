# Overview
The <u>Bridge & Roll</u> is a [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount) escape that involves trapping the top player’s arm, bridging and rolling to that side.
# Setup
The <u>Bridge & Roll</u> can be used when the top player is still in [Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FMount); if they’ve progressed to [High Mount](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian-BJJ-Notes&file=Positions%2FHigh%20Mount), then it won’t be as effective.
# Keys
- Bumping the top player forward so they’re on their hands.
- Trapping an arm.
- Bridging and rolling towards the trapped arm.
# Transitioning

# Counter
The top player can try and get their arm free and post on their arm or use their head as a post. They can also grapevine their legs.
