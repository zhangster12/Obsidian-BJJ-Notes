Press your weight into the shoulders.

From 50/50 (underhook & overhook), bring the overhook side foot perpendicular to them, while bringing the other foot to trip. Look back as far as you can, so they follow that direction.

As they try to recover, lock the front headlock (one hand on the chin other on the triceps)

- Option 1
    - As they try to move around, use the chin hand to block the outside knee, so they end up on the back and into side control.
- Option 2
    - Step to the triceps side.
    - Press your forehead into their rib. ( Or turn their neck in the opposite direction)
    - Bring the leg between your knees.
    - Options:
        - If they stand up, wrestle up.
        - Grab the hip into their guard.
        - Back take.
